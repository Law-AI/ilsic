    "input": "Hi All, I filed a criminal defamation case against two foreign nationals and their company (foreign entity but registered in India also as a Private Limited Company) for writing a defamatory email and spreading it with the help of the employer company’s official email system. Status in the case so far:- 1. At the time of filing suit in the court, we made 3 parties (accused) including the employer company in this case. 2. The court issued summons to both foreign nationals to appear in the court but unfortunately missed to issue summons against the company (3rd party in the case). Unfortunately, my lawyer neither noticed nor take any action to get issued summons against the company also. 3. Employer company received the summons issued against both foreign nationals and came in the court and submitted a reply (without having any summons sent to the company) and helped both foreign nationals to run away from the country. 4. They submitted a reply that both accused are not now working with them, while we produced dozens of proofs including videos that they are still their employees and the company is helping them to hide. Court took cognizance on our proofs and issued summons against the company in 340 CrPC case for producing fake/false documents and proofs. 5. Both foreign nationals never came in court. 6. Till now, the court has issued NBWs 5 times and both foreign nationals have run away from the country with the help of the employer company. Police have raided their office also twice. My Questions:- 1. How can I get issued summons to the company from the Court now in criminal defamation case (First Point - As it was also made a party at the time of filing the suit in the beginning and the Second point - Company helped them to run away from the country and we had produced dozens of proofs to establish it also including videos, photos, and other legal documents and 340 CrPC case has also been filed and summons have been issued in 340 CrPC to the company) 2. Please guide me with the provisions also 3. It is a criminal defamation case and both accused will never come back to India now. How can I get justice now? Can the court punish the company to help the accused running away from the country? If yes, Punishment can be in compensation format or jail (Company’s director or Staff who gave false proofs in the court)? Any judgment or provision or example/case? Thanks",

    "input": "Hi I got married on Jul 2007, Wife was a christian and she converted to Islam and we got married in a mosque. We filed an affidavit for her name change and conversion and i currently have the originals of the same and the original mariage certificate issued by the Mosque in Bangalore. Now coming to the problem, we did not consumate the marriage until Nov 2011. She would not allow. Reason she gives is that she's not ready for that now. I was patient. She's verbally abusive. Filthy abuses if we get into an argument. Shouting, yelling, screaming and Swearing. I lived on the hope that once we consumate the marriage things would change. In early 2011 my wife complained of stomach pain. We went and checked and she was diagnosed with an Ovarian cyst which was impending tortion. Meaning a serious one. We had to take multiple MRI's to confirm. The only option the doctors suggested was a surgical removal of the cyst, and since we did not have any kids, they advised us to go for the kid asap, as the removal procedure involved in removing her entire right ovary. with 3 months we consumated our wedding after consulting with few of the leading doctors. She became pregnant in Mar 2012 and we have a baby girl who has just turned 3. Upon knowing that she was pregnant she insisted in going to her mom's house stating that she cant stay alone with me in kochi. I agreed. Her delivery happened in bangalore and i bore all th expences as well. Even after the child was born the abuses continued. It came to an extent that she started abusing me on the streets. Iam fed up. I help her with everything at home. Maid are expensive where we live, hence i helped her in all her chores.Right from washign vessels to cleaning the toilet. Taking care of the child, feeding the child etc., i work in a BPO and sleep for max 3 - 4 hrs a day i didnt mind coz i thought that im doing this for my family, wife and child. No complaints whatsoever and no regrets. But her abusing continued. We lived like a proper husband and wife only for 3 months, meaning we had sexual intercourse only for 3 months in this 8 years. After she was diagnosed that she was pregnant we did not have anything physical. I thought after delivery life would become normal . Nothing changeduntil this min, the last time we had an intercource was in Mar 2012. Her abusing continued, I warned her that i would go for a divorce if this continues. i warned her multiple times but still continued. I told her that im not able to love her the way i used to love her and ive lost it all. She made a big scene out of it and left home, took the child and went to bangalore. Its been around 7 months now since she's staying seperate with her parents. After she left i called her and asked her to come down to start a new life. she denied stating that she does not want her daughter to have a father like me. The 8 KMS between office and home was my world for the last 8 years. Im totally done with her. I dont want my daughter to grow up seeing me getting abused, i think that will affect her behaviour as well. 2 months After she left home i sent her and the child clothes for Ramzan, she sent it back to me stating that she knows to provide for the child. I asked their family to come and speak to my parents in coimbatore, they refused. We did not go as well. I asked her divorce, she denied. She acknowledges that we both cant live together under the same roof, however she is not willing to give me a divorce. She says live alone, come meet your child and live alone but i will not give a divorce. she also says that she would not allow me to see the child if i go for a divorce and she would bring up the child stating that her father is dead. She even threatend stating that if its going to end in a divorce she would destroy me and everyone in my family. Next month we are planning to go to their house and talk. Im very clear about a divorce. I wanna give Talaq and end this. Please advise on what precautions that i need to take.",

Company wanted her to join them to use her PhD tag in front of the customers. She made it clear on initial discussions that she cannot do coding and company was cool about it. They told that they wanted her to join as a lead and no coding is required. My job involves lot of international travel so she has to manage her job and our 3 years old baby on her own. Issue started after joining them. She was asked to start working as a coder which she told will take her some time to start coding. She was learning coding and was doing reasonably good. She was given a help to learn her with coding who used to humiliate her in front of all employees and pass loose comments. He was expecting her to work late night where all other employees are male employees. Our daughter was to be picked from nursery and will go to mom’s office sit in a corner watching iPad and mom will work. Her senior colleague will take all her work and present as his work in front of management. She complained this to management and they just gave her a deaf ear. She was in lot of mental trauma by the behaviour of her colleagues but she still continued thinking this as part of startup culture. She was continually harassed everyday and her life became hell. One fine day she forced to resign from company and was asked to leave without notice period. The issue here are multiple: 1. No respect in workplace and continuity harassment by passing degrogratory comments. 2.no safety of women employee working late night 3. Mental stress leading to depression 4. Undue grounds to make her feel aliniated in workplace and forcing her to resign 5. No notice period and payout for notice period 6. Late night meeting with drinks and poker in office makes me feel unsafe 7. No one to listen your concern even if you take it to senior management Now I am out of company and started treatment of depression and spending time with my little daughter. I really want to take action legally against these guys and needs help.",

A Private company was incorporated under RoC, Shillong, Meghalaya, in the year [deleted] with an authorized capital of Rs.10, 00,000/-under companies act 1956.The Company did not filed any statutory documents such as balance sheet, annual report etc from the date of incorporation till the year 1995.However the company filed only balance sheet at 31.03.1996 on 08.07.1996 while submitting application for strike off. The company filed an application & affidavit for struck off citing reasons that it is not doing business since incorporation nor will do any business in future. The RoC issued struck off order on 17.02.1997, without imposing any penalty. 2. There is a multistory commercial building whose value will run into several crore near the main road which has clearly violating building by-laws and causing difficulty to commuters under Guwahati Municipal Corporation. When I approached Guwahati Municipal Corporation for demolition of the building for by law violation in the year 2014 it has emerged that the construction permission was obtained in the name of above Company in the year 1984. Guwahati Municipal Corporation is initiating action against the owner of the building since January 2015 for by-law violation. In the meantime I approached RoC, Shillong, Meghalaya by filing RTI to obtain information about the Company. They have supplied all the documents. 3. The documents reveal that the Directors of the Company filed a fraud affidavit to strike off the company. There it was stated that the company is not doing business since incorporation nor will do any business in future, whereas it owns a multistory commercial building since 1984 whose value will run into several crore and several lakhs of rupees is collected as monthly rents from various business entities operating from that building. It might have other assets which I don't know. I have filed a complaint to RoC, Shillong, Meghalaya for taking appropriate action against the Directors of the Company, but in its reply they said that RoC cannot take any action as the company is struck off. RoC has advised me to approach court of Law. 4. Issues: Please advise me what legal action can be taken against the Directors of the Company at present under the above facts and circumstances for filing a false affidavit to strike off a company and other related issues as mentioned above. It is also to mention that I don’t have any direct dealing with the company but I am interested to take action against it.",

Since year 1978-79 we are paying the land revenue to the government of Bihar/ Jharkhand up to 2016-17 and land was in our possession as per our knowledge and was lying vacant . In December 2014 I approached the local land revenue officials to carry out the demarcation of my land before I start any construction work but with no response. In August 2016 when I visited at site I found someone has encroached on our land. Based on the changed situation I approached the Jharkhand Government CHIEF MINISTER official grievance redressal forum. i got the response that as per their records the total land area was found to be more than 220 decimal in place of 170 decimal.It seems that it is a case of dual registration and dual mutation by land revenue officials.And as such to redress the problem I will have to go to the competent court.

To her shock, when her son returned he too forced her out, drove and dropped her 30 km to Noida, at my house. Previously she was forcefully pressurised, beaten, poured on with cold water by same son to transfer her 40-year-old property in son's name.

My friends and relatives have discouraged me from going to the police because they think either Police will not do anything or will demand money. Also i currently live outside India and in a fix. I am thinking of emailing or filing a online complaint with the EOW of Mumbai Crime Branch. What options do i have?",

My father already has Special POA from me regarding the property purchase. How can I make this gift in a smooth way without having to visit India please given the travel restrictions? 1. Would I need to just make a Gift Deed here and get it attested by Indian consulate? 2. Would I also need a POA so my Father can get the Gift deed registered in India? 3.

    "input": "Buyers: Joint owners 1. Husband: Mr. X Sojer 2. Wife: Mrs. Y Sojer Buyers were represented by POA which was notarized in the USA but it was not adjudicated in India and it was not registered in India in the sub-registrar office. Let's call this POA Mr. POA_Buyer, also Mr POA_Buyer passed away 2 years back and he executed the sale deed on Mr X and Mrs Y's behalf in 2010. Mr. POA_Buyer was the father of Mrs. Y and the father-in-law of Mr X. Unregistered GPA document was notorized in 2009. Sellers: Builder: ABC Corp Ltd Landowners: 5 individuals Both builder and landowners are represented by Power of Attorney: Mr POA_Seller. This POA is registered in the sub-registrar office. Property Transaction Summary: Mr. X Sojer and Mrs. Y Sojer purchased a property from Builder A and the 5 landowners (sellers). Mr X and Mrs Y(buyer) were represented by POA_Buyer and BuidlerA and 5 landowners(sellers) were represented by POA_Seller and the sale deed was executed and registered in the sub-registrar office by these 2 GPAs, effectively transferring property ownership to Mr. X and Mrs. Y from sellers. Current Issue: 1. Seller's GPA was registered(buillder+landowners), while the buyer's GPA was not(Mr X and Mrs Y). Is it necessary for the GPA of the buyer to also be registered, GPA was only the signing authority, and ownership is in Mr. X and Mrs Y's name only. The new property transfer Mr X and Mrs Y now wants to do without any GPA to a new buyer. 2. Mr. X and Mrs. Y are facing questions from a new buyer regarding the registration of the GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer not being done. 3. Additionally, there is a typographical error in the sale deed, where \"Sojer\" is misspelled as \"Sojar.\" Solution: 3 opinions I learned based on the feedback on this case from 3 lawyers, they are follows: Opinion1. Registering the correction deed mentioning spelling mistakes and certifying the unregistered buyer GPA in the sale deed from buyer side as valid by Mr X and Mrs Y should solve the concerns and make everything legal. This correction deed can be executed by Mr. X and Mrs Y with the seller's GPA and registered. Opinion2. The Seller GPA becomes a witness to the new sale deed registration between MrX and MrsY with the new buyer. This protects from all issues that may arise due to an unregistered buyer GPA. Opinion 3: This issue has become too complicated and not recommended for new buyers to go ahead as the title to the property is not certain. Please suggest how we can solve this problem for Mr. X and Mr Y and also the new buyer so that new buyer becomes the rightful owner and also not face problems in reselling this property later.",

Her Husband, my brother-in-law who was then 42, is employed with a Leading Airways in a senior management position. Based on her family her Job profile, we accepted the alliance and soon after marriage within a month shifted to Mumbai. She also took a sabbatical for a year from her Job, and was planning to resign after a year. This was more of an insurance in case things don;t work as desired. Soon after reaching Mumbai, she realized, her newly found husband is carefree and self centered without any savings, living in a rented apartment and a huge liability. Her husband was not considerate about her and she found her self all alone without much support from him. In the mean time, she conceived but things didn't turn up better so after staying there for about 8 months with about 6 months pregnancy she decided to conceive at her paternal place, Kolkata. She flew back all by herself, and rejoined her Job. As an unfortunate turn of event, there was a delivery complication, and the baby was in NICU for more than a month. Even after that doctors advised to continue to stay in Kolkata. In the mean time, after staying 2 months with her in-laws she shifted to her parents place and continued to stay there. She requested her husband to help her financially, but he was not cooperative. Within a year and a half, it was soon evident that the baby boy was autistic. Even after all efforts travelling to different places including NIMHANS there were little improvement. There were still no support for her husband and used to irregularly wire her just 10,000 bucks for supporting his Kid though his net salary was closed to 90K/month. She was skeptical to fly back to Mumbai as staying with him for 8 months it was clear that he would not be able to support her and the Kid. Moreover without any physical, emotional and psychological support from him, she best decided to continue to stay in Kolkata with her husband occasionally visiting her. In the mean time with her savings and with my support she purchased an apartment with rest of the finance from Bank, the entire EMI being supported from her salary. She initially though that she can somehow change her husband's mindset by making him more accountable so added him as a co-buyer in the apartment. In the mean time she conceived again, and fortunately it was a normal delivery. But even after that her husband was not a bit supportive and even stopped sending money regularly. Things turned bitter and she is now least hopeful about the relationship. Now currently she is supporting her two kids, her Job her EMI all by herself, and our parents who are getting old is staying with her. She is now seriously contemplating for separation and ask for regular maintenance from her husband. Unfortunately at the current scenario, she is not in a good financial position to hire a good lawyer nor she knows any one out there and feels helpless as to how she should proceed. Can you please help her realize what is the best way she can proceed now?",

While I have fulfilled all terms and was ready to give good money as well for my child. 2. In my contest divorce case, and what strategy can help me to get my divorce with/without kid custody fast since I’ve obeyed all terms in MCD and she betrayed me and filed false 498a. Will judge do me favors on above grounds? 3. Will this false 498a have any impact on my current and changing job that I need do for some reason",

A year later, her family also accepted our marriage after understanding that I am a good guy and having government job. Everything was good for 04 years and then we started to plan for family. But my wife could not conceive, we also consulted a gynaecologist and she said everything is normal. After 5-6 months she had severe pelvic pain and when we consulted an other gynaecologist, we came to know that she had severe uterian infection. She had a laproscopic surgery for it and she started to blame me for not having babies. She has always been very wild since her childhood as she and her parents told me. I also took her to a psychiatrist in the 4th year of marriage due to her violent behaviour. All these years I had ardently followed her and supported her in her business financially and physically. Further, she was never comfortable being at my parents house or if they came to visit us. She loved shopping, travelling and of course I always spent it for her. Which sometimes affected my financial situation. I was posted in Khargone district where she shown her violent behaviour and even banged my head on the door once in which I nearly could have lost my eye. My landlord knew about it. But since I loved her, I remained silent about it. Her family, my family, my landlords family who cared for her like their own daughter, all of them tried to change his behaviour, and she never changed her behaviour. Since she never liked to live in a small city and her medical condition gave her an opportunity to move to a big city. She started pushing me to get a transfer. Due to her, continuous push and abusive behaviour I could not help but ultimately applied for the transfer. Since I am in government organisation, getting a transfer takes time, she said that if you are not getting your transfer done, just shift me to Indore and you may come whenever you get your transfer orders. To save my marriage, I had no choice but to agree to her condition. She started living alone and started to mentally harass me everyday for being busy and not calling her many times a day or having long phone call talks. Later in December 2019 she started fighting with me, interrogating about my finances claiming that I am having an affair or I am going to prostitutes, since we did not had physical relations since Feb 2019. As it was not comfortable for me to have physical intimacy with someone who fought daily with me. Since I couldn't take it anymore, I told her that it would good for both of us to get separated and after that from past 3 months she is threatening me of filing a police complaint against me for mental harassment and that she will destroy my career and family. I want a divorce but she is lingering it. What should I do? What are my rights? What can she do legally. Can I file the divorce and police complaint against her for cruelty",

The original certificates, which are submitted by the students for various attestations and for joining in higher courses and the certificates received from the universities on behalf of some students applied for the same, through our Institute are seized by him, without any enquiry. Office is locked illegally. My manager was taken into custody. Just within 15 minutes, he did all these by 10.30pm. He made an FIR under cheating, forgery i.e., sections 420,467,468,471-IPC and made our manager as A1 and arrested him. Then A1 got released by bail. My brother was the founder-secretary of the parent Society (Regd.) in 1992, but he left the same society in 2012, before started admissions at pune branch. Police got a paper of Society members list of 1992, on the basis of that, unfortunately, my brother’s name is also incorporated in the said FIR as Accused No.2, hence, now he is trying for Anticipatory bail. Here, no complaint, no complainant, no victim, no informant, no specific allegation except here-say information from an unknown phone call of the competitors. No proof of any offence is established in FIR as no single fake marks card/blank certificate/scanner/ printer/ university stamp/etc is seized. Even, the unknown phone call didn’t reveal any of the names appeared in the FIR. But FIR states that my brother’s name is quoted by A1 as the owner of the Institute, but it is false. No cheating is reported by any aggrieved party. Can we quash this fake FIR?? SRAVAN",

    "input": "with reference to my previous question on maintainability of partition suit by daughter against her father during his lifetime in Guwahati Assam, advocates in the kaanoon panel have given some diverse arguments. Some has said it is maintainable and some has said it is not maintainable , because Assam is governed by Dayabhaga rule. Now as a common citizen I want to put the following arguments against the Validity of Dayabhaga rule- 1. The preamble of the HSA 1956 says\" it is an Act to codify the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus \" so in my opinion the Dayabhaga rule, which is not codified by Parliament of India is null & void. 2. overriding effect of HSA 1956 under section 4 (b)\" is any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act\". so in my opinion Dayabhaga is null & void in Assam. 3. When it comes to custom in conflict with the Act, the Supreme Court in Sheela Devi case felt that SEC.6 WILL PREVAIL OVER the old Hindu law. It was noticed by the Court that the Parliament enacted the Hindu Succession Act, 2005 with a view to confer right upon the female heirs, even in relation to the joint family property. Please comment very specifically on this issue with supporting act and argument.",

    "input": "My brother married 27 years back a girl from a rich family having only three daughters, he stayed in our home town for 5 years after marriage and had two sons, its a sort of happy middle class family. Then his wife insisted and pestered him to shift to his in-laws city Mysore, he denied initially, she started threatening saying she will commit suicide if he didn't agree for it.Finally he moved to Mysore after winding up his business and selling his immovable property at our place . Bought a house in Mysore in the name of her wife from the funds he mobilized. Joined in-laws business for some time and then he opened a separate shop in the in-laws premises itself as they could not do business jointly due some differences. At this point he planned to return to our native place and start all over again but wife did not agree then, In-laws provided the space (shop) to carry separate business by taking his signatures on RS 500 stamp blank paper. He could earn only to meet the expenses of a normal middle class family ,educating his two sons in engineering streams.But his wife totally unhappy with the developments as she needs to have a high class life style,so the differences cropped in and grown to a every day arguments and fights. Elder son ,a brilliant engineering graduate joined Microsoft in Bangalore, and left the job with in three months and started his own business and struggled for three years and could not establish himself and incurred some losses, exact losses known to him only.,so my brother was sending money to him for his monthly maintenance as all the capital investment given to him was depleted. Mean while, recently his younger son, engineering graduate looking for a job committed suicide due to depression and health problem (medical treatment and counseling was going on since three years when he made his first attempt to end his life.) After his death , the family totally collapsed and my brother had no \"piece of mind\" and he was totally disturbed , so he went to Thirupathi to seek blessings of Lord Venkateshwara and when he returned after 3 or 4 days, the most devastating things had happened here . One: his wife and elder son vacated the house taking away all the house hold goods ,articles and jewels leaving behind his clothes and personal items and handing over the keys to the house owner. Two: his shop is locked with master keys and he is unable to open the shop with the regular keys and carry on his day to day business. Three: when he went and asked about all this, with his in-laws ,they said we don't know ,go ask your wife and son only . Four : received threatening phone calls from son, saying don't try to break the shop doors if you do so, we will break your bones. Just simply take the left over items from the house and go away from us and do not try to contact us and show your face for one year at least. Five: My brother wandering here and there ( mysore and Bangalore) with out proper clothes and food since one week ,not knowing what to do. His health is also upset since two days. Six: He does not want us (brothers) to approach his in-laws, wife and son for discussion, saying that his wife totally disagreed to bring in any of our family members in to the matter. Seven: we financially helped him to approach police and advocates. He went to Mysore in the morning with some money to approach lawyer and take legal advice and police protection. we are all worried a lot and sitting helplessly here. Eight : son also taken away the car standing in my brothers name, so if something bad happens it comes to his head I am the only qualified and educated brother to him .so what and how best I can help him under this situation. Please, please help me with right legal solution and advice for the situation so that I can save my Brother.",

The magistrate failed to consider my expenses, dependent parents, and 80C deductions and rather went with the Gross Total Income in my ITR. I also made it clear in the written argument that the wife has work experience of 3 yrs and is a computer science engineer, although she's not working now. I'm a freelance writer and my income from profession is fluctuating. I'm surviving only from interest income (sold my house 2 yrs back) 1) How do I go for appeal and what are the chances of reducing it to 15K per month? For 2018-19, my ITR figures are : Gross Total Income Rs. 7,82,537 Deductions Rs. 1,62,501 Net income Rs. 6,20,040 2) Secondly, how long should I have to pay her (divorce and RCR cases still going on in her town). 3) She's adamant and not accepting for MCD. Can I do a bulk payment of maintenance and go for renunciation after say, 5-7 yrs of so?",

The buyer has paid a sum of rs.2 lakh in cash and is not ready to give cheque of balance payment of Rs. 23,75,000/- before 3 days of registry so that it could be credited in my bank account before signing the sale documents to protect my interest and neither ready to give DD of balance amount on the date of registry as he is saying that it will levy heavy charges to him and neither ready for doing rtgs payment before registry and asking us to pay the charges of rtgs / dd and insisting for paying a balance sum of Rs.23,75,000/- through cheque dated (date of registration) and will be handed over to us at the time of signing the registration of documents and handing over the original documents to him. It is pertinent to mention here that the purchaser is not availing any housing loan for purchasing the property as if the housing loan is availed than the financing company pay through banker's chq on the date of registration but in our case its a self financing and the buyer is paying through his own sources . The problem is there is no property dealer in this deal. This deal is direct party deal. What should i do in these circumstances. To the best of my knowledge, it is prudent that every seller signs the documents after getting the full consideration amount either in cash or realizing the full payment in bank account. Please guide me what to do to protect my interest. Does it advisable to sign the documents and hand over the original documents of the property on the basis of the cheques being handed over at the time of registration of sale documents.",

    "input": "Hi post my parents' death, my sister in law filed civil cases against me and my sisters to put pressure on us in Delhi. Me and my sisters reside out of India and they probably thought that we will come under pressure and relinquish our inheritance. However, my brother and us signed an MOU and registered the associated documentation to settle the inheritance without my sis-in-law knowing. Once these documents were submitted in court by us, she got to know and filed a false case against me claiming sexual harassment over a year before filing the compliant with the police. Delhi Women's commission instructed the police to file an FIR post which I applied and got anticipatory bail from the sessions court - the order indicating motivation for property and also citing delay in filing the compliant for no plausible reason. She had also filed criminal complaints using section 156 (3) and 166 claiming forgery, fraud etc. for MOU (attested in Indian consulate) but those complaints have been dismissed by a different court as well. My brother has also joined her (probably under pressure or otherwise) - we have not been in touch since the FIR was filed (2 years). My questions are: 1. I was granted anticipatory bail almost 2 years ago but no charge-sheet has been filed yet. Is this normal? What could be the reason for delay. 2. I have been living abroad for almost 15 years but have an Indian passport. Is there any danger to my status or when time comes for passport renewal (which I will do outside India) 3. As they are running out of options in civil cases, can they maneuver things to get my AB cancelled to put pressure? 4. Does the delay in filing the charge-sheet create prejudice against me? 5. Would I have to go through the trial or can I apply to Delhi High Court to quash the FIR based upon evidence I can produce? Appreciate your time to respond to my query. Singh",

I have never demanded any money in writing or verbally. I'm ready to return that but girl is asking 8-10 lakhs for the settlement. At this moment, I am already marriaged 2nd time as per muslim law since my 1st wife didn't agree to stay with me after trying to convince her since long rather demanding much money initially due to my good financial background. It was a cheat marriage which was done for money. There are few queries from my side: 1) She is demanding litigation amount as 15k although she is getting stipend of amount 55-64k every month. I have a proof of her bank statement 2) I don't have any income, I just get 10k at the moment to manage my stuffs with the support of my family Do I still need to pay maintenance amount to her? 3) Is there anyways where I can put back any case on her so that she can agree to close the case sooner?

He and his mother visted so many doctors to get the baby aborted but they failed 9. He took me to Fortis for treatment and his parents urged him to leave me home saying she need attention and care , he did the same saying she need care and she full attention. I took 1 month sick leave and mediclaim from my office. 10. He visited me on Sunday till july 27, 2014 but speak only little with me spend 2 hrs with me and then go back, besides this no phone call, no monetary support , no help. 11. All medicine, doctors visits are with my parents. 12. When I joined back office in the month of June 2014 after recovery, I insisted him to take me back home for which he gave me several excuses so that he cannot take me home and I got intention that he will never take me home.i resigned from my job with tha hope to go back to him as he said leave job first but after I stopped working he stopped all means of communication with me and ignored me like anything,no watsapp, no call, no message response . 13. When I messaged him 1000 times he messaged me in very rude manner that don’t disturb me as I don’t want to keep you with me I am fed up of you and much more and I cried a lot and informed parents, so my parents visited him to talk to hi, approached his parents to amicable settlement but no result came, my parents said all will be fine once baby born. 14.

We got married in Baroda (girl's hometown) on 27/12/2020, following which we lived in our marital home in Kolkata with my parents up-to 20/3/2021 (3 months) following which we immigrated to the United States. We lived together until 07/11/2021 (7 months) following which she left for India and deserted me. I have following questions: 1. Does the party that files for divorce first have any upper hand? 2. Considering that Kolkata was the last city that we lived together in, would Kolkata have jurisdiction? 3. In case the petition gets filed in Baroda first, can we move to Kolkata on the ground that my senior citizens parents (69 - father and 65 - mother) would represent with Power of Attorney as I am residing in United States? I am aware that jurisdiction is based on where (1) where the marriage took place (Baroda), (2) where the couple last resided (Kolkata) and where the girl currently resides (Baroda). Due to conflicts, seeking clarity on whether Kolkata courts would have jurisdiction in this dispute. Thanks in advance.",

    "input": "I had paid Rs.4.0 lakhs in 2012 to a landlord as an advance for buying a house. She had got that house from her sister through a gift deed and her sister had got that house from her mother through a sale deed. For some reason, the agreement didn't get thru. The landlord send me a legal notice saying she is going to forfeit the amount. Since forfeiture was not mentioned in the agreement, a civil case was lodged to recover the amount. Initially, since the landlord didn't attend any hearing, an ex-parte judgement was passed. At the execution stage, the landlord appeared and applied for a miscellaneous case. I allowed for that and the case went on. In 2016 (July or so), judgement was passed in favour of me. Judgement was to pay money along with interest. Post this, landlord absconded. We filed for execution and court Amina could not find her place of stay (she was staying in a rented house) to serve the next set of execution steps. After a lot of exercises, I realized I can file a case to attach her property. In November 2017, we applied for attaching her property. Luckily, the court agreed to attach her property by looking at some old documents (that I had possessed during agreement). Amina and other procedures (like TAMTAM) were carried on. After this, suddenly her sister applied an objection in court claiming it's her property. When dug upon, we realised the landlord and her sister cancelled the gift deed and the title of the property was transferred back to the landlord's sister. Her sister even claimed she paid Rs.10.00 lakhs for cancelling the gift deed. Based on the above, I wanted to file a criminal case against the landlord and her sister saying the transactions were done with criminal intention of cheating me with my money. My advocate, Chidanand, who is usually unresponsive and gets ideas from me many times is again not responding to my calls. I had, in fact twice, gone to him asking to leave the case aside so I can find an alternate lawyer, but he convinced me saying, case is in the final stage and he will continue with due diligence and be responsive. While I know he is incapable, I had no other way than to stay with him all these days. Now my questions..... 1. What action can I take against the landlord 2. What action can I take against the advocate 3. What do I do now to recover money I was also thinking to file an objection for the application that was filed by her sister asking court to make the transaction (cancellation of gift deed) void, but advocate said that is not possible. Need some solid response please.",

After that she said yes to keep the baby and from on her attitude towards us and my brother changed and started torturing my brother with questions and fighting with him for small small things saying that he doesn’t care for her words.This girl always wants to go out till late night and eat outside and also pester my brother to take leave from work very often which my brother can not afford as he works for a private sector.

    "input": "Hi Sir, The situation: Wife is not willing to live with husband. Wife is not willing to give divorce to the husband. She is keeping total custody of the child and is not allowing the husband to see the child. My friend got married in 2010. He is from lower-middle income group. His wife is also working and is of much higher income than my friend. Due to petty issues now and then, his wife deserted him within 5 months of marriage. She was pregnant at that time and eventually gave birth to a male child in 2011. My friend (The Husband) wants to live together with wife and child and made several efforts. But all in vain. He was never allowed see the child, even at the time of birth Eventually, in 2015, he filed for Restitution of Conjugal Rights. The trial is about to begin. His wife is totally reluctant to join him (Counter filed to that effect). So, even if the court passes an order in his favour, his wife is not going to join him for sure. In addition, the wife would continue the fight in upper courts. At this point, he came to accept reality and want to seek divorce on the grounds of “Desertion”. The wife is not willing to join him in marital life. She is not willing to give him divorce unless he gives up the child. The husband is not willing to lose the child altogether. So there is no possibility for mutual consent. So, for child, he decided to file application for joint custody. The husband is in a dilemma as to how to go about the divorce. His advocate suggested him to withdraw the RCR and file a Divorce petition with Desertion as ground. My friend wants to seek second opinion from this forum as to the right approach. Is it possible to file Divorce petition with desertion as ground and stating that he is more than willing to live with wife and child and if that is not acceptable to the wife then he would like to get divorced ? Can the husband file Divorce petition without withdrawing his RCR petition ? Or should he absolutely withdraw the RCR petition in order to have the divorce petition admitted ? Can the husband file a Divorce petition and ask that it be heard together with RCR petition ? He really wants to live with his wife and child. But if that is not possible, he wants divorce. Whatever it is, the wife is contesting RCR. And she would contest Divorce as well. She just wants to trouble the husband and keep the child to herself. Would really appreciate if you can provide any suggestions or recommendations.",

I would like thank this valuable forum from the bottom of my heart for posting free legal advice in many matters which had guided the family like us which had became a prey under False 498A cases. I would like to bring to your kind notice that : My elder brother's marriage was solemnized on 07/05/2023 as per Hindu rituals. Post marriage my sister in-law had stayed at our home along with my brother,father and my mother for a duration of 17days and post which due to Aashada masa rituals, my sister in law had gone to her parental home which was sent with due respect love and her. There were no disputes in family at all. Now before marriage itself my elder brother and my sister in law (future Husband and wife) had awailed a personal loan of 9lakh in the name of my sister-in-law for their secondary source of income from homestay business. now after marriage since my SIL had demanded for moving out of station for work and settling there, thus inorder to not have burden of loan my brother had pre-closed their personal loan take in the name of my sister in law during Aug 2023. All the EMI towards that loan period was transferred to my sister-in-law from my brother from first EMI at Jan 2023 to July 2023. This pre-closure loan amount was demanded to be paid in hardcash to them by father-in-law of my elder brother( by visiting our home and demanded our parents ) for which our family had denied and pre-closed that loan only through digital transaction/net banking facilities. Now after this pre-closure of loan, My sister-in-law and her father and her brother -in-law had invited my family (which included my elder brother, father, mother and few elderly relatives) to have a talk at their home. Their elderly relatives consoled both my brother and SIL for resolving matrimonial dispute if any. Surprisingly after 2days of this visit, father in law of my brother had started demanding for 30lakhs to our elderly relatives, and said if our family denying to pay which he would lodge false complaint from her daughter and drag all of us. We had denied to his blackmail. Again the same had repeated from father in law of my brother and they demanded 25lakhs nor they lodge false complaint on our entire family.Again when refused, they started demanding 18-20lakhs. If not again false complaint would be lodged. The same threat repeated in the same month of aug 2023. With distress condition having hope on future life with his wife, my brother had file RCR request and post which they filed false 498A case on my brother, father, my mother and included me. Before filing case her brother-in-law had threatened me over call that their move/implications may harm me, to settle with amount. Now false 498A R/w 34, DP act 3,4 is lodged and AB is sought and Quash petition is filed in High chour and case is stayed for father, mother and me. Can we file case of money extortion, blackmail, and criminal conspiracy by my brother on his FIL",

    "input": "Many years back, almost thirty -- when I was barely a teenager---my father's business partner in a city in Maharashtra, duped my father of lakhs of rupees --saying the money had to be paid to a top Maharashtra politician; else the business will close down (small scale industry).My father trusted and gave the partner about 8 lakhs which is equivalent to about 4 crores of today. The partner whom my father trusted was lying (about the money to the politician) and deceiving and defrauding my dad to steal his money, despite knowing my father was a heart patient with severe angina and heart disease. When few days later my father learned that his partner had deceived him, he went into a shock and suffered repeated heart attacks (3) in span of 30 days and thereby died....heartbroken and betrayed. He was an HONORED FREEDOM FIGHTER of the country. Now thirty years have passed, but a horrible crime was committed. Is there any chance that the culprit, who is still there, should be booked under sections of IPC, Cr.PC and investigated? I am sure the police will learn lots of shocking details once an honest investigation takes place. Can an FIR be registered and a police case initiated against the man who stole my father's money and caused his death? If yes what's the way to go about it? He is now squatting (encroaching) on our ancestral property! My father had fought valiantly for India's freedom and was honored by Sanman Patra by the state government in recognition of his services to the nation. The freedom fighter, his children and his widow deserve justice...Please advise, please help.",

Somehow he agreed to have separate kitchen from them, but asked me to do all the house works and leave my job. also I should never meet my parents.Husband is very moody and suspects me for small small things says that I am intersted in another man. He abuses me with really bad words on and off depending on his mood.always checks my mobile. For 5 days he locked the main gate and didnt allowed me to go out neither meet my brother or parents and made me to do all house work even when I had high fever.somehow I managed to come back to my parents house and informed my husband that I have come here but still he abused me with whom I slept.I thought he will regret for how he treated me but instead he is still abusive that says that I have left him.it has been one month since I left but still no calls from him only abusive words. I dont want to go back.and want to put case against them for dowry and mental harrasment and want separation. They treat woman as an object with no freedom and I want to teach them a lesson .How strong is my case?",

When questioned for the same she gets irretated and doesn't reply or reply very irrelavent and illogical. 4. No positive attitude towards life. 5. She always complains against her parents about her raising. 6. My whole family feels mentally tortured and suffocated due to her acts and behaviour. 7. Besides her ill behaviour with me and my parents we never harmed her physically or mentally, even supported her in all possible manner to make her comfortable. And we have sufficient proofs for the same. In a recent event she tried to commit sucide, but was saved because the liquid she consumed couldn't affect her to that level. And the reason of comminting sucide was an objection by my father about her ill behaviour with guest at our house. Next morining we called her parents to discuss the situation. But my in-laws misbehaved with me and my parents, imposed irrelavent allegations and took her along with them. It is now 20 days since she had gone. Now they are insisting me to call her back but I am affraid that she might commit suicide again. Please suggest 1. if we take her back and she commits sucide again (by chance) how I can be legaly safe of this situation. I feel she has that tendency or some psycological disorder. In other words what step I can take before bringing her. 2. There is possibility that under some planning my in laws may file a legal suit of domestic violence under section 498A etc after she reaches us. 3.

I had a job offer from London so I was planning to fly to London soon. When I moved in with her I realised she lied to me about her past. I came across a message on her phone from April 2013 where she had texted her friend that she got married to this xxx guy. So I tried to dig in more and found some pictures of her on her laptop. After confronting her she told me she was engaged to this person and apparently they had court marriage but she told me it doesn't stand valid as she didn't go for second signature. I didn't know anything about court marriage and 30 day period etc. As she had studies law I believed her and forgot about the matter. But after I moved to London she decided to stay in India as she wanted to pursue her acting career in Bollywood. She said I want divorce and doesn't want alimony or anything from me. I did try to convince her but she didn't budge. So finally I decided to seek mutual consent divorce, but now since she failed in her career & out of money, she told me she won't divorce me. Her parents called my parents asking for money. The other important thing is she said I don't want to have divorce process in Mumbai & will only apply if it is done in Pune. 1. What does the first sign and 30 day period and then 2nd sign in court marriage mean? 2. Does marrying in court but not registering still considered one as married? 3. I want to know if her marriage before ours is still valid & does that make my marriage with her void? 4. On what grounds can I file divorce? Or I can file for annulment of marriage? 5. Can I file a fraud case against her & her parents? Your help is much appreciated so I can proceed in the right direction. Thanks",

As per the decree he is suppose to pay certain amount for daughter till the time she is married on which he hasnt been doing so since the time of divorce. My question is as follows : 1. I want to legally adopt the daughter and for that do I need a registered Deed of Adoption?. After 2010 amendment, can my wife give her daughter for adoption to me? Or we still need the biological fathers NOC where he is already disappeared since 2011... Awaiting yours in anticipation. Thank You.",

They approached Allahabad high Court for quash of the same but the judgement came below: \"...after considering the various decisions including State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal (AIR 1992 SC 604) that there can be no interference with the investigation or order staying arrest unless cognizable offence is not ex-facie discernible from the allegations contained in the F.I.R. or there is any statutory restriction operating on the power of the Police to investigate a case.

Hence, no ground exists for quashing of the F.I.R or staying the arrest of the petitioners. \" After this verdict they joined the investigation under compliance of 41A and IO taking witness statement(he came to delhi NCR to do the investigation which is outside his jurisdiction).

In Apr 2017 I approached the President of my apartment association and explained my interest to have a dog in my home. He heard me and said that he'll talk to the Secretary and rest of the association committee members. In a couple of days I met and spoke to the Secretary also. He too said that he will talk to the rest of the committee members and asked me to give a written letter. I wrote a letter and shared the same with the Secretary. I wrote that my family would ensure that the dog doesn't disturb other apartment residents. I did it to be a good apartment resident and neighbor. I moved out of India afterwards but my wife, daughter and father-in-law still live in the same apartment. After about 2 months in Jul 2017 my daughter bought a 2 month old puppy and brought it home. My wife and daughter ensured that it is vaccinated. They have ensured that the pup doesn't bark or disturb others or bite or scare any other members of our apartment. They also made sure that the dog doesn't soil any part of the apartment. About a month later in Aug 2017 the Secretary of our Apartment association called and spoke to my wife and daughter asking to discontinue keeping the dog. I believe that my apartment association has no veto power over my decision to keep a dog in my home so long as I ensure that the dog doesn't bite or bark at other residents or doesn't soil any part of the apartment complex. I also believe that they cannot deny the stairs to my dog as I suspect they might do. I intend communicating the same to my apartment association. Please advise",

I sent my wife with her parents on 31st of Dec.'17. TIll Feb.'18 we had been chatting over phone very well. After 22nd of Feb.'18 when she had a call from some unknown no. she started quarreling with me over phone & her mother too got involved in that. After that I surrendered my no. & our communication was no more. Each member were having their own nos. but they were not ready to get her connected to me. On 03rd of March 2018, when she met with an accident once again every one started communicating with me for her treatment as doctor had advised her operation which was costing around Rs. 50K as per doctor. I had got mediclaim, so her treatment was covered through that which costed me around 82000.00. After that I managed to get her back home to Noida. But I was unknown of the fact that during her three months spending at home she was engaged with some other guy. She came with her younger sister with a game plan in their mind. She didn't wanted to give time to myself despite she kept on talking to her boyfriend. When I got some of the proof of her calls when I recorded her calls both of them got annoyed & tried to blame me that I have wrong feelings about my sister in law. In the mean time when I was unknown of their affair, she requested me to transfer some money to her boyfriend whom she told me that he is her brother. With the help of that money she asked her boy friend to arrange for their tickets & also he send them Rs. 3000.00 to my wife's account. Both of them they escaped from here once again to her parents. Now since two months I'm trying to call her back. She is refusing to come back. Now a days they are also not picking up my phone calls. When my sister & my Bhabhi wanted to talk to her, they [Her mother & herself] always threaten to go to high court. Kindly suggest. I don't want to lose my wife & son. Plz. help sir..........",

She have only mother in law who is not ready to get shifted to Bangalore due to this reason my sister husband has completely left without caring about my sister. She have also told him to balance both like taking care of her and her son and her mother in law as well but he is not at all agreeing for any kind of plans provided. She had no peaceful life in her married life from the day one she kept facing many issues with her mother in law and husband many time they counted even for providing food for her but still she never complained abt them anytime she kept adjusting and never opposed for their ask.

    "model_output": "In Karnataka, leasing of agricultural land is possible under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 and the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Section 105 of The Transfer Of Property Act, 1882 states that a lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised to be paid, and is not a transfer of the ownership of such property.\n\nAs for buying or leasing agricultural land, it depends on various factors such as the purpose of the transaction, the duration of the lease, and the intentions of the parties involved. Here are some general pros and cons of buying and leasing agricultural land in Karnataka:\n\nBuying Agricultural Land:\n\nPros:\n\n* Ownership: The buyer has the right to own the land and can use it for any purpose.\n* Long-term investment: Agricultural land can appreciate in value over time, making it a good long-term investment.\n* Control: The buyer has complete control over the land and can use it as they see fit.\n\nCons:\n\n* High cost: Buying agricultural land can be expensive, especially in areas with high demand.\n* Maintenance: The buyer is responsible for maintaining the land, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n\nLeasing Agricultural Land:\n\nPros:\n\n* Lower upfront cost: Leasing agricultural land typically requires a lower upfront payment compared to buying the land.\n* Flexibility: Leasing allows the lessee to use the land for a specific period, which can be beneficial for those who want to use the land for a short-term purpose.\n* No maintenance: The lessee is not responsible for maintaining the land, as this responsibility typically falls on the lessor.\n\nCons:\n\n* No ownership: The lessee does not have the right to own the land and must return it to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\n* Limited control: The lessee has limited control over the land and must comply with the terms of the lease agreement.\n\nIn conclusion, whether buying or leasing agricultural land in Karnataka is more feasible depends on the specific circumstances and intentions of the parties involved. It is essential to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option before making a decision.",

As a husband and wife, we are not doing well at all. We have had trouble since many years and even now there are so many problems and so many dissatisfactions with each other. And I am considering going down the path of divorce. The only big problem to sort out is for the kid. I am Dutch citizen. My wife and kid are not. If I approach the court here and file for a divorce, I am sure it will happen easily and smoothly. But I want my kid to stay here in Netherlands. And also my wife, so that the kid could get to see both parents. But I somehow see it to be very difficult, and I am not sure she will be able to live and work here alone and manage the kid every other week. Also if things work out like that - how does the Indian law system approve of this divorce? Would it be possible that the divorce would be dragged to Indian courts and if it does, as a Dutch citizen would I have trouble? I am only worried about my wife going to India with the kid and deciding to not come back. Would she be in violation of any laws? As I have spoken to Dutch lawyers they tell me that it's not legal for your wife to take your kid to some other country. If the local law gives me the right to see my kid every other week and stay with her for every other week, then it's not legal. But what would happen if she goes and doesn't come back? How does all this affect my parents who are still in India? I don't know what to do and what this road will bring. But one thing is certain, it's very difficult to live a life like this and we need to get separated. This is not the life we want for ourselves. Please suggest the \"genuine\" options I have in this matter. And I would be glad to get in further discussions directly with you about the matter if you can help me out get a better understanding with your answers. Thank you very much Arvind Gupta",

She came after 3 months of marriage to me and said that i still want to marry you but can not marry as her family will face problems. So she promised me to give her 6 months and after that she will tell her decision. Also she told me that she has no physical relation with her husband till then. So i agreed and gave her time. But after 4 months she told me that i have physical relations with my husband earlier and you can go now. I told her why did not you tell me the truth before. She cheated me since start and used me like a trash. Since start i spent around 3 lakhs on her. Forget money as i loved that girl like anything i got mentally too disturbed.

He thinks she is uneducated and can't get a job anywhere and keeps torturing her on the same point. Though she is graduated and worked before marriage. Last year, she was beaten by him, so we registered an NC and took her to my home. She was at my home for around 8 months. He was not even asked her to come home. Once she returned home with her daughter. That time she got to know that his husband is dating another girl working in his office. When she asked him who is she, he accepted that she is my girlfriend and told her that you were dating your boyfriend for 8 months so now I have a girlfriend. But when we asked him what is going on he refused to accept it. He is treating her like a person who only responsible to cook and serve him. By the way, his parents stay at their village and they don't interfere with his son's activities. They just ignore it, saying that the girl is only an office friend of him. One day my sister got his chat history with that girl having romantic kisses and movie plans. He does not give any money for home expenses to my sister saying he has to pay the EMIs, but gifts headphones, a new mobile phone to that girl. Now during this Diwali, there was again an argument between husband and wife for the jewelry. My sister told him that I have sold my jewelry and got the money to make the food for him, but in reality, she didn't. That time he bit her on her hand and asked to leave his home shouting at her. Also told her that, now he will surely do second marriage with that girl. Then my sister got angry and hit him with a broom. Then he ran away by locking the door from outside. His father was also there when this happened but he did not say anything. She called us to take her along with us. Then we took her and went to the Police station and registered the NC about everything happened. Now she is living with us. She is saying I don't want to spend my life with a person who is characterless and claiming me as a characterless. Now I just wanted to take advice from a lawyer to take the next actions. We are not sure what should we do next, should we send her back to live a slave life, should we keep her to live along with us, in that case, can she get money or claim right in his property for a living? As her daughter is 3 years old, she is worried about her education. Also after 4 years of marriage, he did not even bother to create a marriage certificate. So we don't have a marriage certificate but we do have a birth certificate of her daughter. Please guide any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Pravin",

The status has not changed till today. My wife deserted me after one week of marriage with out informing me. Since then there is no communication from their side. I met his father this year January and After arguing for some time I told him either to send her to my house or otherwise don't waste my time and initiate the process for divorce. He said he needs time but didn't say how many days he needed. After 3 months, in the month of May, I called him and he started avoiding me. With great difficulty I arranged a meeting with the girls parents and my parents including me (my wife didn't attend the meeting). He said recklessly he is not in a hurry to decide about our Problem and said he may further need 3 to 6 months of time or More than that. He said he didn't like my behavior and he should first get convinced with my behavior. They never talked a single sentence about her daughter. Myself and my wife hardly stayed together for 4 days after our marriage. She hardly talked to me. We didn't have any physical relationship. She is extremely introvert and highly stubborn in her behavior. We didn't even sleep together in one room. She has a younger sister who is currently unmarried. What is the solution for this problem. How to get divorce without maintenance. They don't seemed to be ready for mutual divorce (my guess). How many days it will take for me to get divorce without maintenance.",

(The property is being marketed by Indiabulls Ltd. and I heard about the project from a pamphlet circulated by them, near our office.All discussions during flat selection and booking were done with Indiabulls agents. This booking amount submission included a customer cancellation clause of no-refund of Rs. 2 lacs.)AT THAT POINT, WE DID NOT CALCULATE THE CARPET AREA FROM THE SHARED PLAN TO VERIFY THE CORRECTNESS OF AREA DEDUCTION FROM SBU TO CARPET AREA MAINLY BECAUSE A REPUTED ORGANISATION LIKE INDIABULLS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT. On 17-Aug-2017, we calculated the carpet area and observed that there is a discrepancy between the apartment area proposed by Indiabulls/developer(SBU 919 sq. ft.- standard carpet area is 70% of the same i.e. around 640 sq. ft.) and the carpet area of the apartment exhibited in the layout. The carpet area of C1 block as per the plan is around 400 sq. ft. (only 45% of 919 sq. ft.) which is much less than the deduced carpet area for a 919 sq. ft. apartment i.e. 640 ft. Immediately the same concern was raised with Indiabulls sales agent on 18-Aug-2017 and we got a response in email with an attachment, that the plan to be followed in real is the e-brochure plan (attachment) that depicts a carpet area of around 554 sq. ft. This resolved our concern to some extent and hence we DID NOT stop payment of the first cheque dated 19-Aug-2017. Later upon raising concern repeatedly with the Indiabulls sales agent about this gap between the original shared plan and the e-brochure, it was communicated by him that this deviation is a printing mistake in the original plan and will be rectified shortly by the developer. (NB - When we tried to contact the developer for resolution of the concern, we were told that we, customers, will have to connect with Indiabulls regarding ANY matter of the construction or purchase as we have purchased the property from them) After the above said both cheques were cleared, the first demand for payment arrived and the developer agreed to meet us in person. We visited the developer’s office on 25-Nov-2017 and learned from the developer that the original plan (that was told to be INCORRECT by the IndiaBulls sales agents, is the actual plan. The e-brochure will NOT BE FOLLOWED and its AREA DEPICTION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED by us. Hence the carpet area, based on which we had proceeded for the purchase and NOT STOPPED PAYMENT of the booking amount, DOES NOT HOLD GOOD. Based on the above scenario, here are MY questions : 1. What are the legal options that I can take for this matter (grouper into 2 categories) ? 2. Can I get my entire booking amount back as the cancellation is a result? CanIclaimAReductionOfEqvAmt",

Police has not filed charge-sheet till date i guess even after 6 months. We all got anticipatory bail. She is living in my home with her family members. Bole to kabja kar rakha hai. My family is out of own house. she doesn't allow anyone to enter. She has locked all the rooms. She shouts n even hit my family members when they go there. Father had installed CCTV cameras in common areas fr his safety as she blames him of violence & rape attempt. but she broke all cameras. She also go to tenants and ask for rent.She is violent not us. She can fight with anyone. she can hit anyone. even i got 2-3 knife stokes frm her. we r contacting police but they do nothing. Don't even take complaints against her. But they are ready to take complaints against us if she files. That is my ancestral property and still in the name of my late grandmother. Father is tensed and seriously thinking of selling that property. I also lost my job because of dowry case. Police had came to my office in Delhi. That time i hadn't got bail. Honorable judge of Patna high court clearly told her on her face that she is a liar as she was trying hard that i don't get bail by crying n shouting. U can imagine how she is if can shout in high court. She says na mere sath rahegi aur na hi chhodegi. Everybody in my whole family is now pissed off. I m in Delhi and my father is not allowing me to come there as he is afraid of filing more false cases upon me. My condition is like I cud do anything now to her. She totally ruined my carreer and my life. I m also thinking to move frward as it getting difficult to live alone fr me without a partner. u know wt i mean.

I have found my wife telling lies to me and not sharing details with me. 2. She believes more on her few friends in local who are in contact since 1.5 years only and that too most of them are cheating her of utilizing her for making meals from my wife while she used to go office. 3. Her family from panipat and elder sister from bangalore keeps asking her to send miney to them, hence she sends amd never ever informs me of this transactions from her account of her hard earned money. And on it, her parents call us and says thay she is taking load of work here and all. Where as i help in all activities of household work equally and even more than her. I bring all household items at home. 4. She arranges her friends to comment on me like, you should take care of her and all. Well, i do take care at my best. But my wife makes such arrangement of taunts and comments from her friend circle. 5. She gets call from her old friend at 10pm also and he ask her to meet after office and all. He continuosly texts her on whatsapp to meet meet and meet. And she does meet and never informs me, just says, i have some work, would be late. So why such lies and all with me? 6. She does not talks proper with my elder sister, and talks so rudly. 7. Her elder sister basicslly guides her with tricks and all to trick us and harass us. As same ways her elder sister has done to her husband too. My wife's middle sister, i.e. 2 years elder sister is already facing divorce case since 3 years just because of her wife's nature and her tantrums. So i am finding her too.of same nature amd feelimg threat that she may cheat with me and family at any point in life. Hence i would like to safe guard me. As these days i am seeing so many cases where girls and their family are chesting with boys family. 8. We have got married without any dowry, not a single penny we took nor we expect either, as we are strictly against the dowry system, infact we gave dowry while marrying my sister. Her family members, father mother snd brother and sisters have no affection of being their sister and dsughter, as they never ever did any riwaz for her daughter post wedding, simply got her married and forgot her, just want money from her for their work. This is really not fair ways. Well, i do not expect even a single penny nor any gift from her family, but they should not believe without beeing seen the home and facility here, well her parents never visited her post marriage.is this the affection. Amd they are living in a n abandoned home in some government quarters in thermal plant and they all.have lived there only since childhood. And now when they came to city post wedding they are not able to digest the luxury, comfort, life and all. Kindly help me to safeguard. Many thanks",

But my marriage couldnot consume, because my wife had some infections etc. I took her to a doctor just 2 days after marriage there my wife refused to get her examined, doctor wrote this: \"Patient Refused Examination\" on her prescription. Doctor gave few medicines, life continued but marriage could not be consummed. Thereafter, in March,2018, I took her to a very reputed doctor in Gurgaon, she also wrote infections etc on her prescription and gave lot of medicines. In both the cases, I was asked to sit outside and nothing was told to me, but in gurgaon while leaving doctor told me that if these medicines dont work we will operate your wife. I kept quiet and left. Wife took medicines, but nothing happened. 2. She works in Gurgaon, I am the only child of my parents and my father is no more. So, we were just 3 people: Me, my mom, my wife. her bevaiour was very bad at home, to cut short, she found faults with everything my mom does. Whenever I argued with her, she cried badly and theatened to commit suicide. I had to keep quiet. 4. Then, in May,2018, she said she cannot live in such atmosphere. I was thinking of what to do, I used to call her brother, sister, but they didn't help, while going through we didnt get chance to talk about doctor. 6.Her mail box was open on my system, and I found her non vegetarian chat with 1 person (dated before marriage), in that chat my wife was asking for sex and telling about pain in her private parts etc. 7. I called my wife's brother, sister, told them about this chat and sent the chat to them on whatsapp and said i will call them in 10 mins. They saw the chat and switched off the phones. In the eveining I confornted my wife, she accepted the chat, called her brother, packed stuff, while taking her jewellery, took mother's jewellery, cash and left home. 8. Next day I called them, asked for truth but they said girl doesn't want to live and wants divorce and aksed their marriage expenses.I agreed and asked to tell what they spent (fact is they didnt spend anything, it was extremely simple marriage). They agreed they will tell me. 9. There after they stopped picking phone. I went to that gurgaon doctor again and showed her, her last prescrption and asked what is the disease, she said that she is not fit for sex, she needs to be operated and then go psycological counselling, she gave all this in writing. 10. Then, I again tried contacting them they said they are ready for mutual but never came back on terms. Then, I had no option but to file a case of marriage anullment with all doctors prescritions. 11. Now they have changed their nos., they have completely cutoff and they have also not filed any dv, dorwy nothing (I have audio recording of her brother,sister where they said that we never misbheaved with her, didnt ask dowry). How can I get divorce, my mother's jewellery, what else I do?",

    "input": "1. I am Mr Debanjan Mandal. I have a flat at Jal vayu Residency, 337 Motilal Gupta Road Kolkata-08. The flat was bought from Air Force Naval Housing Corporation. I have own the flat since 2006. 2. My in-laws are senior citizens and dependent on me since the demise of their only son. Since 2006, my in-laws have been staying in the said flat and looking after the property with Power of Attorney. I being in service, I use the house for staying during my leave period from service. 3. There is no registered housing society of Jal vayu Residency; however there is a working management committee which is elected every year. In 2016 during the Annual General Body Meeting, the house passed a rule saying that only family members (owner and his/her blood relatives - parents, brother, sister, wife, children) can stay in the flat. Anyone else staying would be treated as tenants and will be liable to pay tenant maintenance charge which is Rs 400 above the normal or owner maintenance charges. 4. Due to this policy, my in-laws were treated as tenants in my own flat and this has really hurt their feelings. They have rendered enormous service for the betterment of the housing complex and it's occupants since its inception in 2006. They have always felt a part of the society being my in-laws. They are proud that I am a service military officer and when such an alienating rule was made by the ex-military personals it has really dent their feelings and pride on the military. 5. I have taken up the matter with the management committee on the following grounds (a) I have told that the house is a self occupied house as per my IT return and my family which includes my in-laws are using the house. (b) I have told that they cannot define my in-laws as tenants on the basis that it does not fall in their definition of family. (c) I have told in the letter that i will continue to pay as per owner rates till my query is answered by the committee. However they have not given me any reply and put me in the defaulter's list. This has been derogatory and insulting to me since i have always paid my dues in time. 6. I have never faltered on paying my maintenance charges. But due to the difference in charge and the difference in opinion between me and the committee, they have made me a defaulter and displayed my name in the defaulters list. This has hurt my reputation. 6. What are the probable course of action that I can explore legally to get my in-laws their due in the society and not be considered as tenants. is the management committee correct in considering my in-laws as tenants or taking tenant charges from me when the house is declared as a self occupied house. Thanking you D Mandal",

She also has taken the help of the local Mahila Mandal , politicians and police to threaten and intimidate us. She has warned us of adverse consequences if we file for divorce and that she will bring the Mahila Mandal people, police and politicians again and will \"show us who she is\". The Mahila Mandal lady also warned of bringing TV channels to our residence if we try to divorce. We are planning to file for divorce. 1. Is it advisable for us to make the first move for divorce? 2. My wife is still living in our home. What will happen if she gets the divorce petition when she is still in our house? 3. My wife is not working and is therefore in the house all day. My elderly mother who also is at home, stays in fear all day of her. What can I do to safeguard my mother? 4. Can the Mahila Mandal people still threaten us once we file our petition in the court? 5. We have not demanded or taken dowry. What can we do to protect ourselves from false cases? 6. My sisters who live abroad call my mother and me to enquire about our welfare and how we are faring in this situation. My wife is therefore claiming that my sisters are interfering in our married life. Can she name my sisters in false complaints? What should be sisters do in such a case? Will they be able to travel to India?",

I rated him as GOOD, and the page prompted me to do so from within the mail and when the page opened up and said I can ask one free follow up question. I had specifically addressed my query to Mr. Jogle. But despite the passage of almost 14 hrs. since my last post, my second follow up question or his answer to it has not been show case under My Questions. I wonder where has the question gone? Please help me. Ansar Naqvi My question was with regard to approaching the A.P. High Court U/s 482 and or 561 of Cr. P.C. and pray for quashing the civil suit in the A.P. State Waqf Tribunal and Criminal complaint, F.I.R. and Charge Sheet on the grounds of lack of Jurisdiction, since there is a legal bar against the institution or continuance of the proceedings U/s 52 A (3) which reads:\"Section 52 A (3) No court shall take cognizance of any offence under this section except on a complaint made by the Waqf Board or any officer duly authorized by the state Government in this behalf.\" Because in both cases the complaint is not filed by the Waqf Board and there is an express bar on all courts for taking cognizance of any offence under section 52 A, filed by a private person. The other grounds for invoking the inherent power of the High Court U/s 482 and or 561 of Cr. P.C.are: (ii) where the allegations in the first information report or complaint did not make out the offence alleged; And In our case whether the property concerned is a waqf property or not is not yet decided. It can only be decided by the Waqf Tribunal only if the Waqf Board files a Suit for eviction and repossession in the tribunal. So long as the property in question is not proved to being a Waqf and being a religious structure or a place of worship or any object held sacred by any class of persons or a burial place, or any place of sepulcher, or any place set apart for the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, the question does no arise of any defilement, insult to the religion or religious sentiments of any class or group of persons, or outraging of religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs or wounding the feelings of any person. The question of insulting the religion of any person, with the intention and knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby and the accused commits any trespass, defilement, demolition, or changing the nature of occupancy of a place also does not arise until it is proved beyond doubt that the premises or structure was religious in nature. (iii)where either there was no legal evidence adduced in support of the charge or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly failed to prove the charge and will not lead to conviction.",

We have Formed a Society now for investors per RERA, our question is there are few other developers who are interested in the Project who can complete this project. The Problem is as a society we are helpless the Project and MOU lies with the Developer who does not have any fund to complete the project nor he is stepping out so that other developers can complete this project. Is there any way where any Authority Like RERA, High Court etc can Intervene and Do a forceful convenience to the Society or Probably Appoint any Project Management Firms Like SBI Caps to Step in so that Project can get completed under the supervision of the Authority and the Builder has no control or Say with the New Developer. Right Now the Developer has vested interest in the project so neither he is completing the project, He has no funds to do so nor he is co operating to ensure a smooth take over by Other developers so investors are badly stuck, we have already waited for 11 years now for a 50 storied tower to be constructed it will still take about 4 years, so how many years can we just keep waiting. Question from us is what can be the way out. we need to get the developer out of this Project asap. Thanks a lot for your responses.",

    "input": "Agreement: 16th September 2015 Projected Completion Date: March 2017 Over 5 years I was given several assurances and promises made about completing the project and every time Akshaya has failed.Yet I have always paid invoices on time whenever an invoice was sent to-date I have paid close to INR 50 Lakhs. Initial year and a bit I had invoices coming almost every month or at least almost every two months and it was easy to keep of track payments, however once the delays have been happening I had no idea of when to expect an invoice , sometimes there were no invoices for over six months or even a year. This irregular invoicing from Akshaya didn’t allow me to keep track of payments and this must be taken into consideration. Compensation Clause says below: \"In the event of any delay in handing over the Schedule C property, the Second Party undertakes to pay a rental compensation to the First party to the tune of Rs.7,500/- [Rupees Seven Thousand Five Hundred Only] per month in the event of a Three Bed Room Apartment as the case for such delayed period provided such delay not being attributable to the reasons mentioned supra and also subject to the First party having effected all their payments on time as stipulated in Annexure I of this Agreement without any default or delay.\" I have spoken with AGM of Akshaya who said I wont be eligible as there are two delayed payments, I remember at least once the invoice wasn't sent and yet I was chased for payment, on emailing Akshaya they sent me the invoice and I then I made the payment, for this I got evidence in email. I do not recall when the other payment was delayed. I have requested the AGM to send me the details of payments that were delayed, it’s been almost a month and I am still waiting for this email. The property is yet to be completed and is current expected completion is December 2020, Given the property is delayed by over 3 years and almost 4 years, can they really get away from not paying the compensation and also almost 50 Lakhs of my money is stuck with them for years with no interest what are my legal rights?",

She lied about her educational qualification, family, n much more. My wife didn't ever paid attention towards daily house hold activities, the same issues were brought in front of her family, who always protected their daughter(my wife) with assuring us they she would start changing herself. In August 2015, we were blessed with a Daughter. My wife didn't even fed my daughter for not more than 1 -2 weeks. She usually slapped her for no reason. she used my daughter as a tool to stay in the home. She was caught red handed, talking to her ex-boy friend. and same drama from her family, they pleaded, said sorry, etc. she left home in Dec 2016 along with daughter. She filed a complaint in Delhi, and i received a letter for counselling. she has filed maintenance case in delhi is pending, for my reply. I filed a Divorce case in Mohali court. She is ex-parte in the case. Witness n Evidences are closed. pending for arguments. I also have filed a case of Custody of my daughter. Vaccination of daughter was not done while in My wife's custody. I got the vaccination done as soon as i got to know about the same. Feb 2017's vaccination was done in Oct 2017. My wife didn't even knew that when the vaccination was due. My daughter's weight as on Dec 2016 was 10.8 kg when she was in family. My daughter's weight as on Dec 2017 is 11.0 Kg. I have all the medical records, stating her growth in my home. All the above things are mentioned in my petition. The case is pending for Arguments. Following are some more facts that are not attached. My wife is in relationship with some 19-20 yo guy, in delhi. I have managed to collect photographs n videos, with the help of friends of that guy. in the pics she is laying semi nude in blanket in bed. The other pics are of some hotel's room. I can gather hotel check-in details from the hotels. in video, she is laying in bed wearing undergarments, talking to that guy, her voice, n video are clear, and she is accepting about her relationship. the guy is trying to remove her clothes. The proofs for adultery are not attached in the custody case, as my advocate was not sure about, how to proof the same. none of the guy's friends is ready to come to court. My wife is not even 10th pass, financial condition of her family is not so good. She has been threatening me to kill my daughter from April 2017 _ i have the voice recordings. she is using my daughter as a tool. i am very much confused, how can i get the custody of my daughter. I have many pics n a video (with that guy), some audio recordings( proving her condition for not providing daughter basic needs, n all). My questions are. 1 Will i get the custody of my daughter. 2 Will i be able to prove adultery in court. 3 Any alimony, monthly maintenance, I am still be liable to maintain my wife, if adultery is proved.

We were told 40k per month will get deducted. So my parents thought I could happily live with that remaining 50k or 60k. But later on I ask for anything to buy he says I don’t have money left. So I started buying my things on my own with my money. Before marriage we kept a condition that I’m going to work even aftr marriage. My in-laws said they are not interested but my husband made a promise to my dad that he will send her. I refused for the marriage.Then my in-laws said okay we will send her after six months but later after six months they kept on postponing and even my health was not good so I’ve decided to do after an year. And now they are forcing me to have a kid. Let’s think of it after a child is born. I asked my husband what’s all this and he said u make your trials for the job and I’ll support you. He said but you have 3 conditions. It should be near by like 2 kms far from home, household work shouldn’t get distracted and the pay should be minimum 25k per month. I agreed for it. I’m basically an MBA graduate and worked for an year before marriage at my hometown. And now when I say I have an interview they are refusing me to go and they say have kids. They are mentally torturing me. Dress like dis only no western outfits, my food habits everything. I’m literally loosing my peace. They were so many days I keep on crying and my husband simply says be strong don’t cry. Their interference in my life is obstructing my peace of mind. I’m not allowed to go out of the house without my husband. If he takes me then only I have to step out or else I have to simply stay back. At the end of the day the only thing I see is me doing house hold work and nothing more than that. My husband office timings are from afternoon to night before marriage. At the time of marriage they said he will change the timings after the marriage. But he didn’t. He goes in the aftn at 2pm and returns home at 12am and even 1am sometimes. He sleeps till mrng 10am and he’s not aware of what work I’m doing at home. My mother in law acts near him that she’s only doing everything but I’m doing nothing. I’m really fed up of all this acting and I’m really loosing hope in my life because of them. I’m lacking peace of mind coz of the mental torture. They force me to get their things done with out even thinking about my interest. Don’t I have the right to eat, dress and lead my lifestyle as I wanted to. I feel like committing suicide even because of their behaviour. My husband literally doesn’t care about my feelings he just makes sure that I listen to his mother. Please someone advice and help me out so that it shouldn’t affect the relationship between me and my husband. Thanks in advance",

Post that in Covid 2020 she filed a DVA against me which said i did not do payment to her as per the court ordered maintenance which i had already paid and the bank statement also proved it and court ahs accepted it.

    "input": "I am an NRI living abroad. I have a matter currently pending before an Arbitration Tribunal with a sole Arbitrator in Chennai, involving a high value property that I had leased to the other side. Due to my frequent absence from India, I engaged a senior advocate to handle the matter. He in turn delegated the matter to his junior who I believe is corrupt and may have compromised my case to the other side. Initially, I approached the High Court to appoint an Arbitrator from the court's panel of approved Arbitrators because I did not trust the other side's nominees and they did not accept my nominees. However, I later found that the junior who attended the hearing when the Arbitrator was appointed merely consented to the other side's nomination of the current Arbitrator. I feel that the Arbitrator is prejudicial against me. During my cross examination, he refused to grant me suitable dates and insisted that I come all the way from abroad even to the point of jeopardizing my work abroad. However, he has been very lenient with the other side. Also, my junior while cross examining the other side witness did not ask some questions regarding some important issues that the other side has admitted in their pleadings. When I asked him about this deficiency, he said that there is no need to ask since the other side has already admitted in their pleadings. But I feel that it is not a clear admission which could have been obtained through proper questioning or follow up questioning. I feel that the other side could evade the admission during arguments. At this point, the cross examination has completed. All cross examination questions and answers have been documented in written form. The Arbitrator has set dates for the submission of final arguments from both sides. I have 2 main questions for the the distinguished advocates on this panel: 1. Assuming that I change my advocate, is it necessary and possible to cross examine the other side witness again to get the other side to admit clearly what they have admitted in the pleadings? In their pleadings, the other side admitted to demolishing a corner building on my property but in the cross examination they denied demolishing the main building. I was hoping to get them to admit in the cross examination that they at least demolished the corner building which is still a violation of the lease agreement. What would be the procedure to do so? 2. Since I feel that the Arbitrator has been prejudicial against me, I fear that his final order may not be fair. Can I approach the High Court to change the Arbitrator? So far, he has only conducted cross examinations which have been recorded. A new Arbitrator could take a look at the pleadings, the evidence and the answers to the cross examinations and issue an impartial order.",

But, I have not consumated my marriage (I was able to only partially consumate). I dont get erections when I look at my wife. But, I can get erection when I watch p*rn videos. My wife keeps saying that I am impotent and keeps threatening me that she will go for a divorce and jail me. she gave me 3 weeks of deadline to consummate the marriage. Even her father gave a warning to me once that he will file a case in court and I need to pay 40 lakh rupees (which he says is the amount he spent for the marriage. I am not sure if this is correct or not) I and my wife both do jobs and stay in the same home. She never pays a single dollar out of her income for the expenses (like rent shopping and other bills) She says it is my responsiblity to pay for the expenses. I am being financially drained too. I feel helpless. I am trying my best to consumate my marriage. But erections wont happen when I look at her. I have love on her . But I dont get any s*xual feelings towards her. What she also told me was that she was not interested to marry me . But, she had to because her father convinced her. Another issue is that my father told her that I had 2 crore worth of inherited property before marriage. But, actually I have only 1 crore of inherited property which is not yet written on my name. This happened wihout my knowledge. She says this is also cheating I sometimes talk to myself. She said that I had mental problems and took me to psychiatrist . He told I had depression through psychosis and gave me some medicines. She says this is also a ground for divorce. If my marriage goes for a divorce , it will create severe social problems to me and also career problems. Can you please give me any legal advice. What should I do in my case? What other problems will the divorce create to me? What most likely the court will tell? Is this a mental cruelty? Will this result in imprisonment too? How much alimony and maintenance I have to pay. I am highly worried. Please help",

Request your advice in the following matter: The Developer has this less than 3 acres of land that was \"D.C. Converted\" long back and renewed again somewhere in this year or so. Due to this, the Developers have informed me that: \"this land cannot be approved by BIAPPA as it is a small piece of land and D.C.Converted quiet sometime back\". Because this is not a BIAPPA approved layout, they have got a \"PANCHAYAT APPROVAL\". I am not sure is this a \"Layout Approval\" or what....According to my knowledge, layout that are not approved by BIAPPA, BDA or BMRDA; such layout approval comes under the jurisdiction of DTCP to be approved and \"PANCHAYAT OFFICE / OFFICER\" has no Authorization for such Approval. Kindly clarify this with points: 1. What is “Panchayat Approved” layout? 2. Surrounding layout is “BIAPPA” Approved but this land of 2 Acres is not “BIAPPA” Approved. What could be the reason? 3. As per my knowledge, only “DTCP” has authority to approve layout which are outside the jurisdiction of BDA, BIAPPA & BMRDA. How is it possible that “Panchayat Office” approves this layout? Basically is such approval legal by “Panchayat Office / Officer”? 4. Is D.C. Conversion of land sufficient to form a layout & is it allowed to carry any residential construction on such land? What other Approvals & NOC have to be taken & who gives them? 5. Who provides the D.C.Conversion Certificate? How it looks like & how it can be verified? 6. What documents are required to know & as a proof to confirm that: (a) It is not an Un-Authorized Layout? (b) It is not an Illegal Layout?\" 7. What legal hurdles both in present & future we may face if such a plot is bought? 8. What legal recourse is open for us as a buyer before & after purchase? 9. How to verify that “Betterment Charges” are already paid? If “Betterment charges” are not paid how can this be verified? Can we invest in such layout?\" Thank you",

But some teachers were not interested to obey this rule. So we pressurized them to not use phone inside the school. Finally all allowed to obey the rule except one. She continued to use mobile phone. So, I spoke her roughly to stop this habit. Then she stopped coming to the school. She is not completed her syllabus and it is hard for us to find another teacher in this last moment. We asked her to comeback and continue, but she is not interested to continue by allowing this rule. She sent a registered resignation letter to us. We didn't receive it. We sent it back to her without acceptance. We don't want other teachers to do the same. So we terminated her from the job. But we didn't gave her the termination letter. Other Important information ====================== 1. She didn't sign any bond or contract at the time of joining 2. Unfortunately the previous manager not gave her even an offer letter (But she regularly signing in the register) 3. But we have her original certificates for the purpose of security 4. She didn't resigned properly. She sent a registered resignation letter to us. But we returned it without accepting. 5. We verbally informed her that she is terminated. But we didn't handover her termination letter yet. My doubts are ============ 1. Can we take legal action against her (either for using mobile phone inside school or for not coming school) ? 2. She is asking her certificates back. Can we hold it for next 4 months to give a message to the other staff of the school (Because this habit may spread to the other staff also) Please help us.",

    "input": "Hello there, We (husband and wife) buying apartment in bangalore and are overseas. 1. While in bangalore, we gave spa to my brother on stamp of Rs100. During registration, the SRO apparently said with SPA, my brother can't sign on sale deed (will not be valid) although he can do signature in register on our behalf with spa. And there could be problems with SPA in future thus advised us to go for GPA. Question - is SRO giving us incorrect advise? is spa on stamp of 100 incorrect for buying property? 2. I got GPA done then from an overseas notary and sent it to India with my friend and I asked my brother to get it adjudicated in bangalore. Now one of his acquaintance lawyer is telling him it is not necessary to adjudicate (register?) the GPA as it is already notarized overseas and it is sufficient for my brother to sign in front of him for evidencing. Question - is the info given by acquaintance lawyer correct? i.e. Shouldn't the overseas notarised GPA needs to be adjudicated in India? Does adjudicated means it has to be compulsorily registered in registrar's office or is it enough if it is notarised again in India or is it enough is sub registrar evidence it? Question - If the GPA does needs to be registered in Registrar office, can it be anywhere in bangalore (given anywhere registration) or does it has to be in registrar office under which jurisdiction the property is present. Question - the SRO office says, GPA cannot be adjudicated at that SRO, it needs to be done at DR office or some other SRO which has that facility. Is it again incorrect advise? Question 1. If POA is notarised overseas and is apostilled, does it needs further signature from Indian embassy. Further does it needs to be adjudicated in India? Some forums says if GPA is notarised and apostilled then it is a legal document which is accepted in all countries agreed under Hague convention. 2. how important is sending it to India by post and not delivered by in hand? i read somewhere that registrar need to see the envelope in which POA is sent from overseas.",

And there was 1.5 acres of kumki land apart from that. After an year a friend of our neighbour came for settling in our village. And he wanted to have some land for the money he had. My father was a person who help anyone, so, he offered him an acre of land from the land we had. But, recently(I mean, around 7 years back from now) we were financially bit troubled. By taking the advantage of this, our new neighbour legalized the complete kumki land(1.5 acres) in his name. We were unable to act against him due to the financial problem. So, here is the question. From above, by law who will be the rightful owner of the kumki land?. According to me, the 1st buyer should be the rightful owner(that us). If the 1st buyer is the rightful owner, how can we claim back it? Thanks in advance.",

The company didnot accept the resignation in writing. Verbally, the HR and top management communicated the following to me: - They cannot accept my resignation - They didnot agree to my proposal of buying the notice period and issue experience and reliving letter Notice period clause in my employment contract is as below: \"You may quit the company at any time with a notice period of 3 months. Company may also conclude its employment relationship with you at any time without assigning any reasons with due notice or salary in lieu thereof. The Company reserves the right to pay or recover salary in lieu of notice period and to relieve you before the expiry of the notice period\".

Recently, I have received a letter from the company asking for notice period recovery (and have threaten to take legal action if not paid within 15 days) . The recovery of notice period is done to my Total Monthly Salary (employment letter has used the word salary and is silent whether it means basic salary or total salary). In the recovery amount they have adjusted the leave encashment. Queries are as below: 1. Can they initiate any legal action? 2. As per various Acts like PF, etc. salary means Basic Salary and DA. And I am willing to pay the notice period on Basic Salary and DA. Is it wise to approach them with this idea? 3. Can I send them a letter asking for overtime for the 4 years?",

Thereafter police verification had been done, where I produced an affidavit that there had been a police case against me ,with details of it ,but no court had denied me to travel outside the country. Now I have received a notice from the regional passport office Bhopal that states receipt of an adverse police verification report corresponding to my application. The letter is dated 10 Nov 2016 and was received by post personally by me on 16 Nov 2016. The letter remarks AAWEDAK KE VIRUDH THANA KAMPOO PAR CRIME NO 365/15 ACT 294,323,506,34 IPC KA KAYAM HAI. JISKA CHALAN NYAYALAYA PESH KIYA JANA HAI. Letter further states that[ if any court case submit 1. Court certified copy. 2 explanation(required action may be taken by authority) You are therefore , called upon to provide a suitable explanation within 30 days and are required to furnish proper explanation regarding the circumstances under which you had withheld material information. In case of non response or non satisfactory response within the specified period you will be denied passport against this o rany other future applications unless cleared in appeal by the consular , passport and visa division or court] Now a little information about the police case, FIR was launched by me and my neigh bour against each other for a minor argument resulting in a brawl .We are not on talking terms anymore. When I seeked further information about the case from the police station I was informed that a chargesheet had been filed against both parties in the court on 25/10/16 and a date for hearing was fixed but neither parties appeared so next date was found from the court to be 29/12/16. Apparently ,neither parties were provided any notifications of the first date or the filing of chargesheets by the police. My questions to the esteemed lawyers 1)Why am I being accused of withholding information by the passport office when my affidavit clearly stated about the case and its details.? 2)Can the passport office reject my application and confiscate my application fees despite not being denied foreign travel by court? 3)Since the police provided no information of the first hearing and second hearing is on 29 dec, how do I get a certified copy of the court within 30 days. Also is the 30 days period from my receiving of the letter or the date of issue? 4)Should I get another affidavit about the police case and its ongoing status in the court and produce it as my explanation to the passport office. In that case what certified copy of court documents do I produce. What should be the format of my response? 5)Am I supposed to personally travel to the regional passport office to Bhopal to produce the documents. I am a doctor and have a busy schedule. Will sending the abovesaid by speed post work? I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY ANYTIME SOON. Yet I want my passport done with as I don’t want to go through the tedious application process again besides I don’t know if another passport camp will happen in my city anytime soon plus, if am rejected once the reapplication process is bound to only get even more complicated. Any kind of advice on the mater will be highly appreciated.",

All his School Passing Certificates, including his Aadhar Card, are registered for 2 March 2004. But, his first Passport was issued on 7 Feb 2013 with the D.O.B. as 2 March 2003. His second Passport was issued on 6 Aug 2019, again with 2 March 2003 as his D.O.B. Now, my brother is planning to travel abroad to pursue higher studies, for which we thought we should get his Passport reissued with the D.O.B. as 2 March 2004 so that it matches with his D.O.B. on all his School Certificates. After his successful appointment as the PSK, they moved his file to RPO, when he arrived for his scheduled appointment to the RPO Office, they refused to reissue the Passport unless he could produce a Cancellation Certificate from the Registrar of Births & Deaths, stating that his Birth Certificate for 2 March 2003 stands cancelled and his certificate for 2 March 2004 is the only original Birth Certificate. We have tried to connect with several people and have found that there is no such document as 'Cancellation Certificate' and neither would a Registrar cooperate in providing any such document for Passport-related issue. Please guide us on what shall be our next legal steps into the matter so that this issue can be resolved at the earliest.",

While I'm not a lawyer, I can provide you with some general information about the legal aspects of adultery in India.\n\nAdultery is an offense under Section 497 of The Indian Penal Code, 1860, which states that a married woman cannot be punished for adultery, but a married man can be punished for committing adultery with a woman who is not his wife.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that adultery is a criminal offense that can only be prosecuted with the consent of the woman's husband. In other words, the husband of the woman involved in the adultery must file a complaint with the police and initiate the prosecution.\n\nIf you're looking to take legal action against your husband for his infidelity, you may want to consider filing a complaint under Section 13 of The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which deals with the grounds for divorce. You can also consider filing a complaint under Section 406 of The Indian Penal Code, 1960, which deals with the offense of cruelty.\n\nIt's important to note that adultery is not a criminal offense that can be prosecuted without the consent of the husband of the woman involved. However, you may want to consult with a lawyer to explore your legal options and determine the best course of action for your specific situation.\n\nHere is the list of applicable legal sections:\n\n[\"Section 13 of The Family Courts Act, 1984\"]",

He always had a bad temper with me. Sometimes for sadistic pleasures he would twist my hand or put blanket on my face to let me suffocate and then let go. Also, few days before marriage my FIL had demanded Rs. 5 Lakh as dowry without which he said he would call off the marriage. The family was also involved in superstitious and black magic like practices. All this had become unbearable and I came to my father's place.

( she says it is now 6 years as she is still counting days even when I have no contact from my side ) She had proposed me and I took sometime to think and later somehow we kind of started dating eachother. I clarified and declared on the very first day when we met that I would not be able to marry her due to my personal & family issues. That is why I was reluctant. But she convinced that she wanted to atleast spend sometime & she knows and she is okay that marriage would not happen but still she wanted to me to date her. So consensually the relationship went for 2-3 years. Fastfoward now , due to understanding and other issues between us, things went bad and I started ignoring and kept asking for breakup but she always insisted me to stay for some more time. Finally, she started asking me and sometimes emotionally blackmailing me that I should atleast just talk my family for our marriage. Though I was no longer sure about our compatibility due to experience, I still talked to my family about marriage because of her. Later, for sometime, families talked, some disucssions happened & as usual some misunderstandings happened and in parallel, she continuously kept convincing rather emotionally blackmailing me for everything. But in that process of talks of marriage etc, I realized that we definitely can't hold this marriage if it happens as this relationship was now completely one sided. It was her who wanted me to stay and to marry and I was feeling that I am trying for this marriage in her pressure & her her strong desire to marry me. Finally our marriage could not happen and I also did not want to go ahead with marriage as I was sure our marriage would not last. Then she started emotionally blackmailing me in everyway that she will die, she will destory her career, she will come my home and create drama there & thinks like that. She used to send me mails, calls, sms but I started ignoring completely as it was really making me sick. In between all of this, I got a arrange marriage proposal, I informed everything to the girl. When she was okay with this. We went ahead with marriage. So I am married since 2 months now and old girl probably does not know yet. I was worried about her threats so I did not let her know this anyhow. But I am continously getting her threats in mails,SMS etc. She probably hacked my online shop account and got to know my new address in different city and She came there but we did not open door. Now I want to come out of this fear of her threats that she would do harm to her or she would blackmail me and my family for breaking the plan. I want to know what are protective and precautionary measures I can take to secure me and my family in case she does something foolish or try to blackmail me or my family to put some kind of charge like dowry etc.",

    "model_output": "[\"Section 23 of The Indian Contract Act, 1872\"]\n\nPlease note that I'm a legal expert on Indian law, and my advice is based on my understanding of the relevant laws and regulations. However, it's always best to consult a qualified lawyer for specific legal advice tailored to your situation.\n\nIn this case, the clause you're referring to is likely a non-compete clause, which is a common provision in employment contracts. This clause restricts the employee from working for the same client or in the same industry for a specified period after the termination of their employment.\n\nTo escape from this clause, you could consider the following options:\n\n1. Negotiate with your current employer: You could try to negotiate with your current employer to waive or modify the non-compete clause, especially considering the current COVID-19 situation.\n2. Seek legal advice: Consult a qualified lawyer to understand the enforceability of the non-compete clause in your specific situation. They can help you assess the likelihood of the clause being enforceable and provide guidance on how to proceed.\n3. Consider the enforceability of the clause: The non-compete clause might be unenforceable if it's overly broad or unreasonable. Your lawyer can help you determine if the clause is enforceable and whether it's likely to be upheld in court.\n4. Look for loopholes: If the non-compete clause is too broad, you might be able to find a way to work around it. For example, if the clause restricts you from working for the same client, but not from working in the same industry, you might be able to find alternative employment in the same industry that doesn't involve working with the same client.\n5. Be prepared to defend yourself: If your former employer takes legal action against you for violating the non-compete clause, be prepared to defend yourself by arguing that the clause is unenforceable or that you're not in breach of the clause.\n\nAs for what to reply to your former employer, you could consider the following:\n\n* Acknowledge receipt of their email and express your understanding of the non-compete clause.\n* Politely decline the offer, citing the non-compete clause as the reason.\n* Suggest alternative employment opportunities that don't involve working for the same client.\n* If you're willing to negotiate, you could propose a compromise, such as working for the same client for a shorter period or in a different capacity.\n\nHere's an example response:\n\n\"Dear [Former Employer],\n\nThank you for your email regarding the non-compete clause in my employment contract. I understand that the clause restricts me from working for the same client for a period of one year after the termination of my employment.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to accept the offer from [New Company] as it involves working for the same client. I appreciate your understanding in this matter and would be willing to discuss alternative employment opportunities that do not involve working for the same client.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any flexibility in the non-compete clause or if there are any other options available.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\"",

    "input": "Me and my wife are both Indian citizens, residing in the US currently (on H1 visa). It's been 12 years since the marriage was registered. We have a 6 year old son from this marriage, who's a US citizen. I plan to relocate to India. I have been asking for a mutual divorce for the last 4 years, but she wants to stay in the marriage and has been dragging it by some means or the other. She has been spreading slanders about me to the society, alleging that I have raped her and I have been torturing her ever since the marriage. She persuaded me to have a child in order to keep me engaged in the marriage, which I realized later only. She has also been threatening to commit suicide if I file for divorce. Now I realize that all these actions of her are just to keep me in the marriage. I want to move on in my life and I am losing years in my life in this way. I am afraid of what she might end up doing as she doesn't appear to be a matured person at all. So I have two options: 1. File for divorce in the US and then move back to India, or (2) Move back to India and file there. But I hear that women in India tend to misuse divorce laws in India and it can take a decade to get a divorce. BTW, the US state where we reside can grant a \"no-fault\" divorce which means divorce will be granted, no matter whether the other party agrees or not. So which is the better option for me (1) or (2) ? If it is (1), how can I protect myself from any future trouble from her side when I move back to India ?",

At the time of Transfer & Registry of said property, bank informed me about loss of some of the important original documents of the property. 3. In the meanwhile, on the basis of available documents of the said property with the auctioning bank, I applied for loan with one of the branch of the same bank but that branch (of same bank) did not sanction / give loan to me, in the absence of all / complete original documents of the said property. 4. But in my opinion, bank was not in physical possession of required important documents of said property because they never replied to my RTI’s also on this subject (regarding property documents). 5. Bank, then filed FIR with Police about loss of some of the important documents. Afterwards, auctioning bank applied for Duplicate documents and obtained also from concerned U.P Govt. Office. 6. On the basis of Duplicate documents, bank applied for Transfer of said property in my name, after Transfer charges were paid by me. 7. But here also i.e. in concerned U.P Govt. Office, it was noticed that said property is already mortgaged in the charge / name of other bank. 8. Now, since the day of E-auction and till date, i.e. almost 300 days ( 10 months) have passed, Auctioning Bank could not get the said property transferred in my name. 9. As a result of all this, I suffered huge financial losses and physically also, because I could not use the property, the way I wanted to. Presently I am residing in a rented accommodation & paying a rent of Rs 25000/= pm. 10. Moreover said property is lying vacant since then. I have physical possession of the said property. As per govt guidelines, I cannot do any alteration, addition, deletion & new construction etc in the absence of Clear Title / Registry in my name. Now I request you to guide / advise me further course of action (with which all agencies / offices / authorities) for the following :- A. Can a bank (PSU) auction any property without having physical possession of all the Original documents of that property? B. Is this not the responsibility & duty of auctioning bank to get the transfer and registry done in my name? C. What is the time limit for a bank to get transfer & registry done in my name after receipt of full & final bid amount? D. How, when & in what manner bank should compensate me for huge financial losses & physically, mental tension, harassment & torture suffered during the last almost 300 days ( 10 Months)? E. Any other action / point of concern, legally or otherwise, needs to be addressed from my side? Waiting for your valuable advise / guidance to overcome this problem. Regards,",

The executor did not deny or dispute the deed in his life time but after four years of the executor death the executor wife deny the gift deed execution then as per this section for the registered gift deed also if executor wife only denied not denied by executor then also need to call a attesting witness to prove the deed execution? Question 1.C: For more clarity : In this section \"specifically denied\" for a registered gift deed referring by whom denied? Denied by executor only OR after few years of executor death then his wife denial also? ================================================================== PART2: ( Take this separately, pls do not mingle with part 1 ) . A registered gift deed executor died after 2 years, In his life time he did not denied or dispute the gift deed. After five years of death of the executor then the gift deed executor's wife file suit and deny the gift deed execution, She is also one of the attesting witness in the gift deed. She deny execution and deny her attestation witness also. Query 2. A. For this scenario Better to call another one attested witness to prove the gift deed execution?

This year, I asked the owner to consider postponing increasing the rent till next year as we are already paying more than the prevailing rate and also the ac's provided by the owner are not working. Also, there are electrical and seepage problems. The owner has now given us a notice to vacate. The first reason she tells me is she wants to sell the house. She did the same thing last year, threatened us to vacate if we don't increase the rent by 5%. She thinks she can get much more higher rent from new tenants. Other than that she has no reason to ask us to vacate. Now she tells me that her brother wants the house to set up an office.",

    "input": "I am currently working with an MNC in USA. I was married in November, 2014 in India. I moved to US in June, 2015. My wife joined me there in September, 2015. After a few days itself she started quarreling with me over various issues. These issues ranged from trivial issues like lack of personal hygiene (her) to serious false claims of infidelity (citing my late work hours). After 4.5 months in US she demanded to be sent back to India. She left US in January, 2016. After coming back to India, she and her father started spreading rumors about me and my family (residing in India) claiming that we demanded a dowry of Rs 10 Lakhs (!!!) and forcibly evicted her from the marital home in US. After some time (April, 2016), her father came to visit my family with a crowd of relatives and demanded that I be asked to come to India and have a face to face discussion with them. I agreed but owing to work reasons could only come in August, 2016. I informed my wife's mother in July, 2016 that I will be arriving in India 3rd Week of August. I informed my wife's family of my arrival (through one of her cousin brother). There was no response. We started to call her and her family members to set up a meeting but no one ever picked up the phone!!. Out of desperation, we contacted several of our relatives to try and call them but still no response. Eventually, I returned to US after wasting 3 weeks in this chaos. On advise of some of our family members (lawyers), I sent her a final email and on receiving no reply, filed for a divorce in US. She replied back to the divorce notice claiming the following: - I asked her for dowry (Rs 10 Lakhs) and when she denied, tortured her - I threw her out of my home and asked her to return back to India and only come back once she can bring back Rs 10 Lakhs dowry - That she had filed DV and Maintenance case against me in August, 2016 (10 days before my arrival) Now I am facing these cases in Indian court and am at serious legal and financial risk. I have some specific questions (requests) regarding the maintenance case: 1. My monthly pre-Tax salary is around $8K. She has cited this as my income and asked for Rs 75000/ month maintenance. 2. She has mentioned in her complaint that she has no independent source of income BUT we know that she is working with a company in Faridabad and making a salary of around Rs 50K/ month (She has an M.Tech from IIT BHU). We also have some meager evidence - linkedin profile snapshot (now changed), recorded conversations with her mom and cousin Questions - 1. Can the court still award her maintenance? 2. How much maintenance can the court award her? 3. Is it worth to hire a detective to gather more evidence of her employment? 4. I have evidence that she left US on her own accord (whatsapp messages). Would this be useful? 5. In general, how should I approach this case and what kind of evidence/documents should I gather to make a strong response",

I live abroad and filed for divorce abroad and although she opposed the divorce, she secretly got married to her ex-boyfriend. She had hidden the information even during the divorce proceedings (so she committed bigamy). She has custody of our only daughter. She also managed to file a NBW against me, but I never got any summons served to me. My family members are all on AB. But I am not. I have not been asked to go to India by the lawyers we had. I have not seen my family in person for a very long time. We had filed a quash petition in the High court, to quash the FIR. It was at the state 'quash admission' (and it changes daily) Although there were a few hearings, and the judge asked us to go for compromise, the case keeps getting postponed for multiple hearings - sometimes to the next day, sometimes two to three weeks away. So it's a bit frustrating. I was hoping it would get quashed based on the merit of the case in a few weeks/months. And judges change every few months. I'm writing this to understand a couple of things. My passport is coming up for renewal. I need to go to the nearest consulate for renewing it. 1) If I were to apply for the passport before the quash is granted, should I mention that I still have 'criminal proceedings' in the passport application? 2) Will the consulate officers always have access to the LOC record if I mention, or not mention, that I have criminal proceedings in the passport application? 3) Is there any place I can check if I have an LOC against me ? Is it the FRRO website? 4) If the quash proceedings were to still continue for two more months, should I apply to the HC for permission to renew the passport? (Just to note that, I am abroad, and have never appeared before trial court or HC, but cooperated only using my lawyer and now the quash is admitted in HC, and I don't have AB) Thanks",

That time I decided to quit the marriage and even decided to return everything they have given by their own wish. Her grand father was also hospitalized during that time. But we forget and decided to give one more chance. Again after marriage, she told me to take a new car and then I said let me sold my old car and take a new one. We both will contribute half half to the emi. But in turn she told me that she will ask my father to return the four lakh rupees which her family give it on ring ceremony according to their own wish( we have not asked for any sort of money or dehaj..I have the voice proof of this). I said how could you ask this money from my father. This happened on march 2015. From that time onward she keeps on taunting my every time by saying that i have killed her grand father as the money is kept for his treatment. Every time she use to pick to my shirt collars, gives me a slap....making fun of my family and also said many b ad things to me. and she keeps on repeating the same things again and again. I am doing my Phd and begin to loose my mental balance and even thought of telling the same things to my mom and dad. But to save my relationship, i never told these things. She also said that i have taken dehaaj of 4 lakh ruppes and have taken advantage of her always. I am already suffering from this mental agony and have thought of ending up my life for the sake of my parents. Due to these, I got my liver damaged(NAFLD) and also caught up with umbilical hernia. I would have gave up my life uptill now. My treatment is going on and she didnot even turned up once for even stand up with me. I have much more things to tell about the mental tortures I received it from her in the past one year. Recently only I told everything to my parents and she also accepted that she had said all those things in the last one year. Her elder sister is also facing a troubled marriage. Her in laws has alsoready a filed a fraud case on her family that she bring all of the jewellery to her home and then didnot came back from her home. Her in laws also called up last year and adviced us now to marry the gal of this family but i ignored which i believe they were quite right after seeing all these. I am also consulting a psychiatrist to treat my mental condition and would go for the surgery soon. I even cant stay of spending even a single microsecond with this girl.

It would be great if you could provide your valuable advice on how I can proceed and take legal actions against my neighbor. I am residing on 2nd floor of an apartment building. I live with my elderly parents and have 2 flats joined internally. On the 3rd floor there are 2 families. One of the family member (a boy of about 18-19) has a habit of staying up late and making noises (by stomping on the floor? moving objects over the floor? I am not exactly certain how) late at night. My mom has been bed-ridden due to an accident lately and it is of utmost importance that she gets a good night sleep. Unfortunately she is a light sleeper and wakes up hearing those noises. We approached our neighbors almost a year back complaining about these noises but they responded in rather hostile manner and hurled abuses. I don't think trying to talk some sense into them would work anyway. I have not approached the police yet as I am unsure of how to put together a complaint which can make sense to the police as essentially what I am saying is that my parents are disturbed due to my neighbors choose to make use of their own flat's floor in an ungodly hour. I don't know if the law has something to prevent such things and how I would prove it that those noises are creating issues. There has been some talks about the house's construction not being proper and thus any small noises are amplified and carried to us somehow, but I don't hear much noise from the other neighbor who are on the 3rd floor as well and neither the neighbor who are residing at the 1st floor below confirmed that they hear any noises from our home. At this point I am feeling really a bit lost and unsure of what to do. Your advise would help a lot. Thanks in advance! Best Regards, Abhik Basu",

    "input": "In the night of 24.01.2012, my Father was looted at knife point by 4 looters at Highway No. 8, near Pardi in Gujarat. He was traveling in a rented car which was taken from Vapi through a travel agency. He was looted of all his belongings like gold chain, diamond ring, cash, mobile etc. Later after investigation it was found that the driver of the rented car was involved in this crime. My father had installed an anti theft software in his looted mobile which helped the Police to nab the criminals. It has been now more than 5 and a half years of the incident and STILL WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED OUR LOOTED BELONGINGS AND CASH RECOVERED FROM THE LOOTERS, BY THE POLICE. After the arrest of the criminals, we were told by the police that all the looted items and cash were recovered. The victim, My father passed away in 2014. Later, on the advice of local Police station, we hired one lawyer, available in the Pardi(Valsad, Gujarat) Court premise who started processing the documents required to receive the looted items from the Court after we agreed to pay his related fees. He asked me to bring one elderly member from our family in front of Judge so as to get the order passed from the Judge. I followed Lawyer’s direction and bought my late father’s younger brother (my real Uncle) in front of Judge. For this lawyer even took part of the decided fees in advance,. I had paid in cash and have no receipt for the said payment. Later in January 2015, after our continuous follow up, the Lawyer confirmed that related order to receive the loot recovered items have been issued by the Judge. Since then, I have been following up with the said lawyers through phone and some time in person to receive the looted materials. But, the Lawyer keeps giving reasons and excuses to postpone the issue. I work overseas and hence cannot follow up in Person all the time. I try to see the lawyer once in a year during my visit to India, while at the same time keep following up through phone. I would like to have legal advise on following two issues: i. I want to get the looted items (gold chain, diamond ring, cash, mobile etc.) belonging to my father which was recovered from the looters. As understood from Police, all recovered looted material and cash was deposited in the court. ii. Considering the unprofessional approach and working of the assigned Lawyer(as mentioned above) what can be done against him legally. Is there chance that the looted materials belonging to my fathers have been taken away by the Police and said Lawyer, from the Court without our information. Awaiting response from Lawyers of Kanoon.com for above issues. Thanks",

Being a senior living, there were several facilities which are covered as a \"Service agreement\", signed by each flat owner at the time of purchase for a 10year period. Part of this service were \"Specialised services\" where based is payment based on package opted, from an available list. After an initial period of 2 years, the builder along with the society, has decided to make most of the specialised services as compulsory (which as per contract was optional), without approval from each owner. Additional, there have been multiple irregularities in the billing related to the regular charges for service agreement. Even after multiple reminders by email to make corrections, the builder does not respond, just keeps sending bills with the same errors. They also threaten that the unpaid amounts will be deducted from refundable deposits. Now the builder has started interfering in daily services eg. domestic help. All these violations have led to mental harassment health issues for my parents who are senior citizens. I request your support to identify: 1. What legal rights do we have in this case? 2. Is there a way to stop the builder from harassing my parents with immediate effect? 3. How do we proceed on this matter - legally and otherwise to ensure that the builder does not make ilife difficult for them, continuously. Thanks in advance.",

We were informed that the particular member was neither a primary nor a secondary member of any flat, and somehow managed to contest elections. The PMC was further questioned why they didn’t raise the alarm since 11 months, and how is it that they weren’t aware that one of their office bearers wasn’t even eligible to be a society member, even though his name was missing glaringly from the members’ list? A resident noticed his name missing and became the whistle blower, which forced this ineligible member to resign. Further, 2 persons must have nominated him. The PMC was asked to reveal their names, but they haven’t so far. The communication from the PMC to the O/O registrar has gone as if this was a ‘resignation’ in normal course, but resignation is possible only when one is an eligible member, while this case was a possible case of a fraud. Since, the member got elected with false documents, should this be reported as a wrong doing by the PMC to the registrar’s office as a case of forgery? What is the liability of the 2 nominees who must have nominated him? What is the liability of the PMC for concealing the fact of a possible fraud from the O/O the registrar? 3. In Feb 2020 we took certified copies of 13 minutes of meetings of PMC held between August 2019 to March 2020. We found in those minutes Chairman not signing any minutes (signed by the secretary only), minutes of 1 meeting missing, minutes of 2 meetings not having quorum (where many important decisions were taken), attendance register signed by 2-3 members but attended but 7-14, and 1 member signing attendance register thrice but not shown by the Secretary in the list of attendees in the minutes. In June 2020, some of the residents questioned the PMC about these discrepancies. PMC created the lost minutes (after having certified they were missing in March 2020), wherever quorum was missing, an additional attendee name was added and initialed, the 3 places where a member had signed the attendance register but wasn’t shown as having attended meeting",

    "input": "Dear Sir/ Madam, The housing association I live in is in Bangalore and is registered under KSRA. The last AGM (for the year 2016-2017) was held on 31st July 2016 with a followup EGM on January 2017 (increasing the AMC rate for 2016-2017). The AGM for this year (2017-2018) has not yet been scheduled, but the managing committee has already issued an AMC (Annual Maintenance Charge) demand for 2017-2018 and also threatened to levy a penalty on anyone who does not pay within 25 days of the demand. When asked the Managing Committee have responded with \"An EGM or AGM decides the AMC applicable for the year and until another AGM or EGM revises it , the previously decided AMC remains valid\".and are using this as justification to carryover and use previous year's AMC this year. My understanding is that the AMC decided is for a fixed time period (last year's AMC is valid for 2016-2017 and is minuted as such) and cannot be carried over to this year, without majority approval in the AGM for 2017-2018. Given your experience and expertise in the laws and bye-laws of the KSRA and KAOA, could you help us in this matter by answering the following questions? 1) Is the association's.demand for AMC without holding an AGM, without presenting the accounts for previous year and without presenting the budget for this year valid and legal? Is the AGM not essential to authorize the AMC? If for any reason the AGM for this financial year gets skipped, will the AMC decided for 2016-2017 be valid till next year's AGM? 2) The association has threatened a penalty for non-payment of AMC demanded. Given the current context, is that legal and enforceable? A penalty of 1% on non-payment of dues was decided in one of the past AGM's, but given that this year's AMC demand is raised without an AGM, can the penalty be enforced? 3) If a member requests details of the incomes, expenditures and the sinking fund, by when should the information be made available to him/ her? A week? 15 days? 4) Should the managing committee share with members and residents information on the statement of accounts, incomes, expenditures, sinking fund and planned budget for the ensuing year while calling for an AGM? Right now, all we get is a notice for the AGM with financial information being shared only in the AGM. A printed record of financial information is passed around in the AGM for 2 - 3 minutes and we barely have time to make understand the details, before it is taken back. We have had problems in the past, with the managing committee trying to unilaterally take financial decisions without the proper forum of AGM/ EGM and hence we take a cautious approach to matters affecting the residents financially. Answers to these queries will help us decide the way forward and your advice is invaluable in this regard.",

In the meantime she has filed a false court case citing DV seeking compensation and maintenance from my brother-in-law. My question is as follows: 1. Can my brother-in-law file a police compliant under Sections 420 (cheating), 494 (marrying again during lifetime of husband) and 495 (offence with concealment of former marriage from person with whom subsequent marriage is contracted). 2. As the case against my brother-in-law is built on false grounds, in our response we want to declare the marriage null and void under IPC section 494, section 5(1), 11 under Hindu marriage act both declaring 2nd marriage illegal (null and void) and therefore seek dismissal of the case from the court. 3. Can we file a divorce case against them for bigamy and seek compensation for the amount spend on marriage, harassment, cheating and fraud under IPC Section 415 and Section 420.

And also partition was not in equal manner and made without metes and bound in any plot. In some plot were partitioned seperately whereas in some plot, it has been taken jointly. Further my elder uncle made a gift deed in the name of his wife in year 1988 and registered. In the deed, it was mentioned that he has a only daughter too and married with a person whose details were also given in deed however The gift was in the name of his wife. His wife(my aunt) died before my uncle. the only daughter also died before my uncle. later my uncle died. The uncles land is our possession being hier and we had take care of him and aunt till their death. After the death of my cousin sister( the only daughter of my uncle who has gifted some plot in the name of my aunt), her husband arranged another marraige from whom three sons were born. Now the cousin brother in law made his three sons as party and applied in the Circle office to get mutued the land in the name of his three sons on the basis of gift deed made by my uncle in 1988 which was in the name of my aunt and who died before my uncle. my Questiton is : i) Can I challange the partition made on the basis of mutual consent, without equillibrium , without metes and bound and without having registration in sub-registrar office but muted in Circle office. My father has recently died in June 2017. ii) is it legal that my cousin sister sons whether they are step or own will be heir of that gift deed made by my uncle in favour of my aunt after more that 25 years. iii) can I challange the mutation order in DCLR court and on what basis. iv) who will be higher in decree of the land of my uncle, either we or my cousin sisters husband son. it is worhty to mention here that there is no specific mentioning about cousin sister three sons in the git deed as it is only mention that my uncle has a daughter namely X married with Y.

In this scenario can we form an association registered under societies act supported by atleast 250 Owners ( Out of 745 Flats) to represent the owners as a single body in multiple forums to fight for justice and what we rightfully own? It this allowed ? What are the consequences ?",

He purchased this property on Patta in 1930's and built a Kothi in 850 sq yards area. He passed away in 1968, but before that, he executed his will in the favour of his daughter, and through this will we have been inheriting it through generation. We sold some part of it through the years, and it was done properly through the registry office. Then in 2015 we sold a flat to one of our neighbour, which is built on first floor of its back portion. Everything went well, until we tried to sell the rest of the portion. he was with an intent to grab the ground land which was right under his flat. Now he has defamed this land so much through his sources that we are not in a position to sell it. Further, with the help of his neighbour, who runs a digital news paper, he is printing baseless news about our property and trying to prove that we are not the owners of this land at all. We do possess the original registered will of the land, but due to termite attack, we lost the Patta papers. So what we must do to negate the effect of this mal publicity? Though we have registered Civil and Criminal Cases in a district court against both these parties. Suit is on. Kindly help.",

When she was with me at my house for 4 months she harresed that she will file cases on me in court. Finally filed 498A case on me in September 2014. I was arrested on Sep 19, 2014 and got bail in 6 days and came out. I filed divorce case. She filed DV case. On December 10,2014 Order was issued to pay maintenance before 10th of Every month. They haven't shared account number till January 19,2015.In next hearing our lawyer told to court that we are ready to pay maintenance, however she should co-operate for case proceedings. she said she is not prepared. After that we applied in high court that maintenance is high on the other hand she gave a petition saying maintenance amount is low. And then She filed a petition to reject the bail because the passport is not submitted. But when they came to arrest me cops asked for passport and I gave them right away. From then my passport was with them. I told the same in the court. But Cops said it is not with them. But internally when we spoke with cops they said it was with them but they did not submit to court that means it is a issue to them. I don't that I should take a memo when I gave my passport to cops. As I don't have any proof to show that I submitted passport to the cops, with great difficulty I took my passport from cops and submitted to the court. Court warned me by saying that I have to attend all the hearing in person by coming to the court. (Finding difficulty to take leave in office to travel from Bangalore to Hyderabad every time to these hearings) I am paying maintenance for her every month now. She gave all the false evidence of Jewellary bills and also a document saying her father took loan from his friends and gave to me and my dad. All these documents of proof which she gave did not include a Number which says it is valid or not. Thats what my lawyer said in court and to me as well and to the Judge also and asked the judge the same they are all duplicates with no exact purchased bills. Now My lawyer demanded for original bills when the jewellery bought. Wife also kept my CIBIL report. My question is How can a person take the other person CIBIL report by any third party and submit as evidence in the court. In Domestic violence case my wife submitted my CIBIL report in the court as evidence. Can I file different case on theft of my CIBIL report with out my knowledge and shown as evidence in the court? To pay the maintenance fee for her every month which was very huge and I have to do my living with dependencies of my parents the Land which I purchased before marriage with loan on my name I saled it and using that money to pay the maintenance and lawyers fees and so on.. Now by this CIBIL Report she knows that and kept that as evidence I have no idea how this works to the court. Please clarify this. Thanks in advance and your help. Regards Wanted to know will there be any issues if we don't pay maintenance? I want to move my divorse Case fast but she is not attending to the hearings and moving this maintence and 498A case fast in such a way that hearings are every alternative day or next day itself.

Also as per my lawyer, the judge being woman she is not issuing warrant to give her statement in court. Now my question is: 1) After marriage I traveled to Bhopal for one day only to get her back once. (the police fir mentions that date as the start of the dowry seeking and then continuing offence) 2) My parents did not visit Bhopal after marriage even once. So how does the court in Bhopal get to decide the case when whatever incident she is saying (all hitting, not giving food, asking for dowry) etc happened at Jaipur / Delhi (even marriage happened in Jaipur) and not at Bhopal. What is the process and fees which I need to incur to get the case quashed if at all this is a fit case for quashing? The high court is at Jabalpur for my case.",

But after 3-4 dates none of defendants are appearing in court, and against 3 defendants court already issue No WS order,, 5th one is local municipal corporation, pimpri, chinchwad, Pune. And now we have requested court to issue ex-party order against all since no one is appearing in court except local municipal corporation, and its in process Main number 1 defendant ( main person ( local goon ) who has encroached road, ) died this year February 2023, But we were out of town for approx. 1 month for my Son's marriage and when we return in month of march, we come to know from other neighbors that defendant no1 is died Since his sons are also local goon and alcoholic, we have no contact with them. Since its Plaintiff's, Our duty to add legal representative of dead defendants, but none of the defendants is appearing in court and we don't have any proof that defendant no 1 is dead. So I have few questions regarding this: Question 1 - Do we need to inform to court ( orally or in written ), that main defendant is died. Question2 - But if we do this, again we have to send summon to defendant no1's legal representative and again we have to wait 8 to 9 month at least for further process. Question 03 - And our advocate is telling that , why to inform to court since we dint have any proof, exact date when defendant is died, And this will also be in our favor, so that we can ex party order early and no need to fight again in court, since it will take time. Question 04 - And if we don't inform to court, will our case get abates automatically even after we get ex-party order. Question 05 - Since it's already 6 month complete, can we add legal representative name even after that without having any proof. Question 06 - Even if case get Abates, can we fill new case again defendant's legal representative Different Question 07 - Can we fill case in revenue court as well as in local municipal corporation, Pune, since in civil court this is taking time, and will limitation act will apply Or please suggest other solution on this if any. Kind Regards, Sumit Kadam",

    "input": "Dear sir, I was married in year2011. I am B.tech in Mechanical Engg and working in MNC salary 60000 PM. My wife is MCA and was working in software company 4 years backat salary around 30000 PM. She worked till 2013. Although my job was close to my native place (Approx 60 Kms) where my parents were living but still we both decided to live separate and taken a rented accommodation nearby my company. We both were living there since 2011 till 2014. Our relationship was not went well due to her dominating nature. She always tried to dominate me. she never wanted to have any kind of attachment and relation with my parents and brother and sister. Somehow we managed. Later on we were planning for a child and due to some medical problem we could not have child. We checked up with doctor and could find out that there was some medical problem in me. It was a big shock for me. Because of this issue I was very much depressed. She has got another chance to dominate me as there were some medical problem in me. Later on we had twins through IVF (Test tube baby) in June 2014. My wife wanted to go to her parents for 1 month. in our family there is a custom that mother does not go outside the home for 90 days after giving birth to child and neither she needs to work. She should take rest and take care of babies. So I told her to stay back but she started crying and requested to me and my mother for going to her parents. So we agreed. She went there and next day she send a sms to me saying that I will never come back now and I should better live with my parents. there were some arguments with her but she didn't agree. When we tried to talked to her parents they also started blaming my parents. At that time I was so much depressed with her actions. I was now alone at rented accommodation and decided to shift to my native as now babies also requires care and she will not be able to do alone. so I shifted to my native. She is so egoistic that she literally fighted with me over phone and her parents threatened me and my parents that they will take me to jail. after 2 months of silence, my brother and sister went to meet her and to see the babies and as a mediator they spoken with her parents and other relatives also and brought her back to my native. Still she wanted to move from here and continuously asking me to leave this place and go back to earlier rented accommodation but I always told her that babies need care at this time and she will not be able to do it alone. After 5-6 months from then, now again she told the same thing and said she can not live with my parents and wanted to shift immediately but I denied. After 2 days she told me that she have some bank related work at her parents place and wanted to go to her parents for a week. I agreed and she went. After reaching there within hours she called me and told that now I will not come back and if I need children then I should leave my parents. She also told that she will start working now. I talked to her parents also for this but all in vain. her parents always support her at her mistakes also. In last 5-6 months, there were various episodes where she have not treated me like a husband. I went to her parents to meet my babies alongwith my parents and her parents told to take permission from my wife if I want to meet babies. Do a father require permission of her wife for seeing his son and daughter. her parents also threatened me that they will put me in prison. Later-on my wife sent sms to my brother stating that stay away from me, my family and childrens else it will not be good for all of us. She is blackmailing me now because of babies. Actually my inner feeling is that she does not want to live with me anymore and she had taken the babies and separated me from them just to torture me. She does not like me at all due to my sexual problem also. I have tried to contact her relatives also but no-one is coming in between. NO one is helping me out. With so much negative behavior and actions from her side, I am not willing to live with her and nor she want. But I need my children. Kindly suggest what Should I do. I consulted with some experienced family members and experienced friends also but everyone is saying that stay cool and calm and be silent, after 5-6 months she will come back but I know the reality. she is so stubborn and egoistic that she will never come back until unless I bow in front of her. Kindly suggest what should I do. What are the fake allegations she can make as she had already threatened me for same. How can I get separated from her? Kindly help.",

Also she lied to police officer currently and also to previous officer stating my child is on death bed with cancer which wasn't true. There is contradictions every where, she is trying to fill in the gaps. NOW 1....My wife filed for divorce, her cross examination is over , i made application for further cross but it was rejected. I have tendered my statement affidavit. My contention is that my wife is mental, ( compulsive lying) however I cannot prove it in any way except asking questions from her. I have filed my affidavit on last date according to reply which was according to her plaint (but i can still file further affidavit as my cross hasn't started yet),. So this point was never raised. How can I go about it. ? 2...her sexual harassment against FIL is currently going on.... I can ask those question now which might prove her mental state. But her lawyers object in each and every question giving her time to react. I would need a judgement which gives me freedom to ask anything from DV or 498@, or 354 or any other connected case, if i am allowed that, it will solve the purpose. PLUS a judgement which restrains her counsel to object each and every time , because it renders entire cross examination fruitless. Please provide revelant judgment and law so that truth is unveiled. Afterall it's courts duty to find out underlying problems rather than just adhering to procedures. 3 Can I file annulment in currently going divorce and ask for medical examination. She is employed and earning but that doesn't reflects her mental stability but only her earning capabilities. 4....Custody is still not decided. Child is 6 and never allowed to see the child, she filed more than 7 cases. Can I file and ask those questions then but it would be too late. 5... She filed 498@ back in 2017 but chargesheet was filed currently in 2023, dv has same allegations. Can I get it quashed , i mean she can ask those questions in dv anyways or in hma. 6. Can I use this in family court to reopen cross exam or in 354a against father or in dv which is also going on. 7. Please provide relevant judments or citations or law part only. Or any geniune advise, there can't be compromise as she demands 5 crores and i have already exhausted that Avenue.",

    "input": "Hello sir, We belong to Muslim religion. My brother got married to a girl in september 2016 and tha marriage lasted only for 12 days because the girl's family is a fraudster. My brother and that girl found each other on a matrimonial site wherein our family communicated their family, saw the girl's pictures which were photoshopped and editted on a large scale but which we had no knowledge about and so a first meeting was arranged at girl's own residence. At the meeting my brother along with my mother and one aunt and uncle were present. As per our culture there was a seperate seating arrangements for men and women and initially for a long time the girl did not appear infrint of anybody. All of us started introducing one another, food was served long talks and discussions took place and much time later the girl showed up infront of my mother just for a minute or so . She was extremely shy and hesitant n didnt even talk much , my mother just saw a glimpse of her and later my she went infront of all men and there also she stayed for a minute or so with the same shyness , so my brother could see her hardly. But however since they had seen some pics and also they liked her family so in a hurry they thought she is same as picture. And actually she appeared in a heavy make up which nobody vould identify at that time. Finally their marriage was fixed 5 months later and in that period my brother went to their house to fix the venue and other things but the girl hardly came in front or had any conversation with him. They used to have text conversation but the girl would say that she would not come or talk with my brother as feels under confident and shy , so my brother also never forced to do so. Also there was no engagement or any such occasion where in our family could see the girl actually or for a long time , the girls family did not allow so and said they believe in direct marriage. Finally on the wedding day I as the only sister of groom wanted to see the girl and exchange some gifts before wedding ceremony(nikah) as I stay abroad and did not see the girl till now but the girl's mother made some excuse amd said that she will give it yo het on my behalf. So at the time of nikah which was late in the evening again there was seperate seating arrangement of men and women and still they said they will not let see the bride to anyone till nikah and its their family tradition they added. Finally we saw the bride only after nikah and again she was heavily dresses and with a whole kot of make up. My brother saw her in the same way on their wedding night and she said she is not feeling well so they did not consummate marriage. They both slept early as they were tired and the very next afternoon there was reception ceremony on the same venue. On the reception day she woke up early and her mother and other ladies from her family came to collect her to ready her even before my brother woke up. So by the time my brother could wake up she was again already heavily dressed and had a make over because the reception ceremony had to take place since 11:30 am or 12:00 noon. Soon after the reception ceremony we had to travel by train to our city which 12 hours apart so we were all busy in packing our belongings and vacating the hotel and till we left for our home the girl was continously accompanied by her mother, sister and other ladies from her family. Finally we arrived at our home next day following the reception and this is when we actually saw her in her real condition , she was completely different in looks than her pictures and also what they had described about her. She was completely dark in complexion and had patches in her face and skin. Very malformed teeth and every thing else was scary. But still we were confused and did not beleive it instantly , we thought its may because of long journey or tiring wedding celebrations. But day by day we realized her true face and still we were very good with her. My brother asked my mother to ask her that why is looking so different than we first time saw her . She got completely panic and could not answer. She did not bring her phone with her so would use my brother's phone for calling at her home, in that phone there was a call recording application which recorded all her converstaions. After my mother asked her about the difference in looks she mentioned the same to her mother and said to her mother \" that the boy and his family are feeling that they have been cheated , and in a low voice she said which is true. Although at the home also I am continuously applying make up but still my skin has given up and and not able to withstand make up. I am feeling very scared but these people are behaving very nicely with me. \" her mother said dont worry and continue doing the makeup we will come in a week to pick u up as your sister is also travelling abroad so tell them you want to spend time with her.\" And there 2/3 such conversations recorded which confirmed that they cheated us .Finally within 12 days of wedding her parents came to pick her up and asked my brother to come to their house within a month to get her back . Till then my brother made his mind of divorcing that girl and in a month called a family meeting involving 2/3 elder men from each family giving them all the background and that his plan of divorce . They said they will let this happen this mutually if my brother signed a stamp paper prepared by them and also that this is between two families and no third party is involved so whatever is written will only be limited upto them. So my brother agreed and signed that on which it was written that due to my brother's inability to fulfill his responsibility as a husband and all the mistakes done by him n his family he is giving divorce(triple talaq) to his wife. They had said that after my brother signing it they will get it signed by the girl and that the marriage will be dissolved mutually. Now after my brother signing it they took the papers and disappeared and stopped receiving our phone calls and never showed up. My family waited for a month to catch them but nothing happened. Finally my brother consulted a practicing lawyer who prepared a legal divorce notice stating all what really happened and how they procured my brother's signature on false affidavit. After that they waited for another two months and filed a false dowry harassment and DV case against my brother, my mother n me(groom's sister) n I (groom's sister lives in US with my husband , my husband is working here) , they know my contact details of US and the company my husband is working in. However as I told earlier the girl lived in our house only for 12 days and we did not take or ask a single penny from them. So what are the possibilities in this case , will I be called to India to appear for the case and how can I get rid of this. How can my brother and my family be saved ? The girl does not want to come back either but they are sure that they want to take revenge from us . Please advice, thanks.",

    "input": "Sir, am in big trouble.please show me the path. My husband has filed a RCR ( three years back) case just to seek bail in my case of 498A and 34 DP Act. He and my entire in-laws never wanted to continue this relationship, and tried their best to break me down so that I may file for divorce, but to get bail, my husband said in the court that he wants to take me back. Because of all this, I was depressed and had to consult a psychologist and take some medicines. And he came to know about this and came for one day just take a copy of that precription, and I gave it in good faith. (There's nothing much mentioned in the prescription) He also filed a case of stealing his ornaments and certificates against me and my parents, in which police has given us clean chit in the investigation report which they have submitted recently in the court. And we also got to know from the police that one of the neighbours of my husband has filed a case of \"threatening and misbehaving with women\", upon in which He's on bail. Because of this attitude, I said in court that I dont want to go with him. The court then gave him 6 months time to talk to us and take me back with me, but neither he ever made any contact , nor he replied positively to the efforts made by my family memebers and the entire family changed their contact numbers as well. Then I attended the proceedings of the RCR case, where he said the same. This time, I also said yes and decided to go with him, but then as he didnt want to take me back, he never came to my home and made excusese of illness and didnt attended the proceedings on three later dates continuously. The judge in the ordersheet wrote that \"reconciliation proceeding fails, and it seems that the petitioner doesnot intend to take back his wife.\" Now, 6 months later he made false allegations that He went several times to my home , but I refused to go and therefore wanted bail. But I opposed him and submitted the RCR ordersheet, after which court ordered fixed the next date to take me back. But, on that date He bluntly said, \"Now, I don't want to take my wife back and she is mentally ill, and since girl's father is a police officer, I am scared that She might commit suicide and we all will be prisioned. She had said earlier that She doesnt want to go and her father being a police officer has threatened me several times......\" and all that....to which the court said to give these things in written. Now I dont understand where this case is heading. He has spoilt 6 years of my life, I dont wnat to let him go like this...also I dont want to waste my entire life behind him. Please help me..",

    "input": "Hi, my sister is being harassed by her husband and in laws. My relatives and family members held a meeting at our home On Sunday 23/8/2020 to discuss the reasons behind this situation and tried to evaluate the facts. They have tried to reason with my sister’s in-laws and unfortunately her in-laws have behaved very rudely including the husband who have insulted our entire family and also threaten to beat or kill my brother. My relatives, instead of questioning their mistreatments and unfair allegations and serious threats, have tried to compromise and made my sister agree to the terms and conditions put forward by her in-laws. My relatives made my sister apologise to her in-laws even though there wasn’t a single mistake from her side, thinking that it’s for her benefit and that her husband will change in future and that she shouldn’t loose hope and keep going on with the life and be patient. Finally at the end of a 2 hours shouting and arguing my relatives agreed to send my sister to her in-laws house this Friday 28 aug 2020, without my families and sister’s consent. Now my sister is terrified to death about going back and she wants to proceed legally as she and we all (mom, brother and elder sister - father passed away) believe that they have a strong motive to get rid of my sister as she gave birth to a female Child and also her husband has threatened her many times in front Us. She wants her educational certificates and jewellery back. Can we take them back even before we proceed legally. What should we do if they refuse to give both or either. My sister is ready to file either a divorce or go for other option under IPC 125. She is in fear that her in-laws wouldn’t even give her educational certificates and would torture her further more by withholding them. Please could you advice how to get these 2 things back. (We have bills of the wedding jewellery somewhere at home) Do we need to file a case in police station? Or do we need to send a lawyer notice? Please advise.",

Meanwhile husband bail rejected in district court. charges framed under 304B. prosecution evidences going on. 5. Investigation done by SIT and SIT Prepared the report under 304B agaisnt Husband and his brother. But after that they did not produce the challan against the husband under section 304B despite of SIT decision headed by IPS officer. We were under wrong impression that challan agaisnt the husband submitted by police. 6.Other family member again approached director of investigation and marked the inquiry once again for his innocence to linger on the matter to get the bail for husband (his brother) to soften the case. 7. Investigation delayed and husband got the bail from high court, we failed to oppose the bail in high court due to lack of knowledge as we relied on Police. But IO again told to high court that they dont have any proof of dowry despite of complete file handed over to SIT. 8. Now again director of investigation prepared the report against the boy and his brother under section 304B same as made by SIT earlier. 9. But in all this episode they have been able to soften the case and able to get the bail for boy. Queries:- 1.) If now police submit the challan under 304B against the boy and submit thIer report in disctrict court. 2.) Can the husband again be sent to Jail by district court, after submission of challan under 304B.

She filed 7 cases against me (498a/125/DV/DP/Women Protection). Her family even barged in my house for abusing and killing me but i escaped somehow. No one is listening to me and i am jobless now because her father visited my office along with policemen from their location to get the maintenance under 125 or arresting me if I refuse to pay the money; my company asked me to resign which i did. Now court is not accepting if i am not working, despite of presenting my proofs. All the decisions were ex-partied as her father bribed the Peshkar not to dispatch any summons to me. Now one more thing that came in front of me is that she by fraud means obtained my ITR filed by my previous company, basis which she is showing that i had earned 50000 pm salary and on the contrary she is presenting her medical papers that she is mentally ill and that she cannot work. Even she claimed that I am impotent; in fact it was she who refused to have any physical activity as she said she is not meant for it; as per her this is done by prostitutes, so not letting me to touch her. Court is accepting her fake and lies; please suggest me what to do; my 6 years of prestige and honor is wasted because of her. Her only statement is \" She belongs to her father and she loves him only, she cannot live with me any more\", which I do not know what it exactly means. I payed 50000 bucks till now for 125, following compliance and seeking permission for challenging it in High court (by taking financial help of my sisters). Now she again filed new paper for 127, for enhancement of maintenance. What should i do now? Please help me. I lost my job because of her; will I be eligible for getting maintenance from her father?

FIR booked around 300kms from my place called Guntur in Sep 2019 under sections 3,4DPA, 498A however, subsequently 41A CRPC has not been given to us by the police before registering the case nor till date. Bail applied for these sections for parents, since I do not reside in India – my brother who also do not reside in India is not part of FIR at this point. Police on SAME FIR with same date and time different sections have been Added so that my father do not obtain bail.

My brother went to India to help my mother and since my father hasn’t got bail. With information, Police came home and picked up my brother even though his name is not in FIR. Picked on: 26th Oct’19. Police officer who came on 26th Oct also threatened my sister-in-law of dire consequences in this case. Immediately our lawyer has moved lunch motion petition in high court Guntur. Guntur HC has given clear instructions for police to give 41A CRPC and send him from station Now police included my brother’s name into charge sheet.

There is no mention of any 12 lakhs Cash and Additional 12 Lakh in ornaments as she stated in FIR. She signed the MOU. We have video evidence as well. Since the Charge sheet was filed by police high court has given instruction to lower court to get this sorted out. in lower court now, she is mentioning that she does not trust us that we will pay the remaining money of 9 lakh and also not come forward for divorce She is demanding that we will have to pay 9 lakhs upfront for her and file divorce petition before removing the criminal Cases.

Till Dec 2021, he could just finish the base structure and no further progress and still saying that he will deliver in one more year. Now, he is trying to threaten me saying that my payments are delayed and it attracts penalty + GST on it and forcing me to pay that. He also changed his word that he will use internal fittings from reputed brands like Roca, Jaquer, Kajaria and he seems to be using fittings with his own logo on them. When i asked for justification, the employees from this organization suggested to go for registration as such discussions will never end and if i complete the registration process it will put an end to their demand of penalties. After paying 96% of total cost of flat, I am being harrassed by the builder which is very disturbing in my personal life too with no guarantee that I will get my flat in this lifetime.

Separated since 2017. I live in US. Wife lives w son in India since 2017. I filed for divorce (HMOP) in India in Jan 2018. Wife filed MC, DV (against me, my parents, who live in India and sister, who lives in US) subsequently. We requested for my parents and sister to be removed/deleted from the case, as my wife never lived with them. But our CMP was dismissed. Lawyer says that could be because this was the first time lower court judge had to decide on this. Previously deletion/quashing was done in the high court. We still don't have the order. My lawyer is confident that we will win the DV case. I am little skeptical as the judge dismissed the deletion plea. Also, wife's lawyer is aggressive. They could bring fraudulent witnesses/evidence. Questions: 1. Why do you think the lower court judge dismissed our deletion plea ? 2. Should we appeal to the high court and request to remove/delete parents and sister? 3. If we appeal to the high court will the trial continue in the lower court? 4. If we lose the case, will there be any jail sentence? 5. If we lose the case, what will be the maximum financial relief?

    "input": "I got married in Nov 2015. My husband flew to Dubai within 15 days of our marriage. Since then he did not come back nor he called me there. I was residing with his family in India. I was a victim of domestic violence (physical and emotional). Though I tried to kept myself quite for sometime but the In-laws torture was increasing day-by-day. My husband gave an excuse that he lost the job in the second month of our marriage and cannot arrange my travel. Due to lot of stress I became a patient of depression and was hospitalized for treatment. My treatment was funded by my widow mother and brother. My inlaws compelled me to leave the matrimonial house and since fifth month of my marriage I'm residing with my mother, brother and bhabhi. My husband and his family disconnected all communication from me. I contacted Marriage consulate of Indian embassy - Dubai but there also my husband lied that \"everything has been sortout between us\". Finally, I made an appeal in women cell, where I got to know that a) my husband is employed there and he refused to join the mediation and b) he is looking for another bride on matrimonial sites with \"Never Married\" status. My inlaws kept all my belongings and blamed that I ran away from their house. Thus, FIR under section 498A/406/34 was filed in Dec 2016. Within the 10 days of FIR filing, I received the divorce petition under section 13(i-a) duly signed by my husband in India. All false allegations were made. Can anybody please suggest: - How I can proceed further in my FIR as there is no single action has been taken? - I started working in India and working in middle management-earning a decent salary. Can I claim for monthly maintenance from my husband? - Is there in middle way to complete this process as I'm not in favor of asking alimony but I want my wedding expenses to be paid off, return my belongings and mutually divorce? - How long this process takes to complete?",

My parents are also natives of U.P. but settled in Delhi for the past more than 40 years. My permanent residence has always been Delhi and our matrimonial home (the short while that it existed) was in Delhi. My wife returned to her parental home in U.P. some months after marriage and filed a petition for divorce. Besides that, she filed a complaint with the local U.P. police station of her area, under 498A IPC and 3&4 DPA against me and my parents alleging dowry demand and a threat to kill her (not attempt, and no allegation of any physical violence) made in U.P. Apparently, an FIR was not registered even after a subsequent follow up complaint made by her to the Superintendent of Police concerned. She therefore filed a complaint case before the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC). Her and her father's and brother's statements have been recorded and the complaint is now fixed for next month (I don't know, for what purpose). Now my queries: 1. If the JMFC is satisfied, will he ask for a response from police on why FIR was not registered? 2. If the JMFC is satisfied, will I be directed to appear before Court or will the U.P. police be directed to arrest and produce me and my parents in Court? In either of the case, will I be sent to custody in U.P? 3. If I'm to be arrested by police, will such arrest be executed by Delhi police or U.P. police? (all accused persons are living in Delhi). 4. What should be my next step? I think U.P. State Cr.P.C. amendment does not provide for anticipatory bail. Am I right? If so, what to do? 5. Will I get a chance to (a) produce documents in my defence and (b) cross examine the Complainant and supporting witnesses? 6. If yes to #5 above, when will I get such a chance - after appearing before the Court on date fixed OR after being sent to custody and getting regular bail OR without appearing myself, but through a lawyer? 7. What is the evidence value (not admissibility) of a certified medical record of a private hospital, regarding the fact of my hospitalization (just the bare factum of being hospitalized, not the reasons for it nor treatment or anything else), without examining the Doctor concerned or hospital staff? Thanks a lot for any guidance.",

Due to big financial loss, I couldn't pay the 10L to Ramesh's mother hence she filed a F.I.R and put me in Jail ,where in F.I.R she didnot mentioned anything about these blank dated cheques given by me to her son Ramesh as a security. Now when I'm out on bail and trial is on-going, I've received a notice under N.I.A from Ramesh for these cheques which were bounced due to \"Insufficient Fund\" in my account. Kindly help: 1] Please tell me how to handle both the cases parallely as both are related to the same issue? Can i request court to see both the cases as one and not different cases or remove IPC 420, 406 from me and pursue the case under NIA Sec. 138 only? 2] Ramesh has manually put dates seems to be from different INK, can i accuse him of false activity done by him or he has misused my cheques and file complaint against him based on Forensic investigation of these cheques? 3] How can i use this NIA case against me in best possible manner to get out of this mess (420,406) filed by Ramesh mother and live my life freely? 4] What if Ramesh says that Dates are also put by me in the cheque but there is no mention of these cheques in FIR under which my trial is ongoing, how to beat him and her mother in both the cases?

As per Companies Act, 2013, it is mandatory to appoint internal auditor and conduct internal audit. We have examined annual report of these companies.

Jaiswal Akash & Co. , Chartered Accountants, Kolkata (FRN 328324E) as Internal Auditors of the Company for the current financial year.” We also conducted an inquiry with the Registrar of Companies where we found that such companies have filed bogus Board resolutions via Form MGT – 14 for appointment of our firm as Internal Auditor. We had never given any sort of consent in any mode to be appointed as the internal auditor of such companies. We never conducted or performed any audit function with regard to activities and books of account of such companies. Further, we never prepared or signed any Internal Audit Report of such companies. We have not been associated with such companies in any manner be it financial or otherwise. Without any appointment being made with consent; without any performance of audit function and without certification of any audit report such companies, our firm name has been misused as internal auditor by such companies. We understand that it is an apparent case of planned fraud as such companies have not only mentioned our firm name in the Directors’ Report but also intimated the Registrar of Companies that our firm has been appointed as Internal Auditor of such companies without any actual appointment and consent. These companies are penny stocks as per Income Tax Law. We understand that main purpose of these companies is to provide exempted Long Term Capital Gain and accommodation entries. These are jamakharchi companies. Because of use of our firm name by such jamakharchi companies image of our firm has been affected.

    "input": "My grandfather and mother (an eye surgeon) started a business from scratch 23 years ago. My father (a civil engineer) joined the board a couple of years later. Today, that business has grown and my mother, father and uncle are Directors on the board. My grandfather was the M.D abd he passed away without leaving any will. My uncle and grandmother forced my father and cheated him into signing documents that gave my grandmother 92% of the shares and the rest divided into my uncle and my dad each. Now, everyday, my grandmother and uncle come and pick fights with my parents at the hospital, scream obscenities at them and try to bully them into agreeing with my uncle's investment decisions. My parents were harassed by my grandfather before he died on similar lines, and they have had enough. They want to continue working at the business without the mental harassment and drama. They would like to pay off my uncle but he demands that he give us money worth my grandmother and his shares. My grandmother is openly supporting him and my parents' health has worsened because of this constant havoc. I want to know what legal action they can take on my grandmother and uncle, and resolve this issue once and for all. On another note, my grandmother and aunt used to cut up my mother's and my clothes, steal our footwear and make threatening calls to us and my other aunt, and forced us to leave the family home. I myself heard my grandmother 's voice on the phone talking to me and threatening to kill my mother if she didn't 'fall in line'. My parents are not devious people and just want an end to all of this. What do we do?",

    "input": "I was arrested under the aforementioned act by the R.P..F, as a suspect for black marketing Railway Tickets through my personal IRCTC ID. They raided my address and found a few Tatkal Tickets in my phone, which was then confiscated alongside with my computer, which I have not got back. I was under their custody for the night, only to be released on bail by the Junior Sessions Magistrate. I had a single Live Ticket on which the journey was due. Under their threat, I confessed twelve other tickets on which the journey had been completed. I have also provided them with my account transaction statement, which mentions all of those payments. All the booked tickets only had the initial names i.e. only the first name of passengers. I was forced to get three of those travellers to their station, for their statements to be recorded. The statements depict how I levied a surcharge on the base price of the tickets. The only ambiguity I see over here is, that the IDs of these travellers which was recorded by the RPF had their full names, unlike the tickets. I am aware that plea bargaining here will yield the quickest results for me. I am a young college student and have no criminal history. My concern is that I am looking forward to persuade my masters in Canada. However if I plead guilty over here, it will effectively be a criminal conviction which will bar me from the Canadian Visa, irrespective of the relevance and severity of the crime, What options do I have over here? If I contest this case, what ground should I base my defence on? Do I have a chance to get a favourable verdict? If I contest the case, how much time should I expect for my case to be disposed off, an year, two years, three years? If I contest the case and lose, would the court enforce a stricter punishment that is imprisonment on me? Also is the Chattisgarh High Court's 2004 verdict regarding the same binding on my case? It specifies how the RPF has no rights to register a FIR in such case. If that holds true, would I have to approach the High Court for a Quash Application, or this can brought up in the Sessions Court itself. I seek your expert assistance over here.

I am the youngest kid who lives outside India and an eldest son who lives in Bhubaneswar with his in-laws since 8 years. My father has purchased the land, built the house with his own money and effort without any help from my brother. My brother got married 1 year after the house was built and brother & his wife couldn't live in our family home because my sister-in-law wanted the house & land on my brother's name right after they got married. My father didn't want to give the whole land to my brother and he never accepted their proposal even after they asking so many times.

But my brother has been troubling my sisters every single day by creating fights in the family home by visiting the house, instigating them and threatening them by different means. He doesnt help in any of the house matter, but keeps doing cheap issues like asking someone to leak air from my sister's scooty, not letting way into the house gate, bad-mouthing us in front of all relatives etc. We are so troubled that we filed a partition suit against him in Odisha court as well, he doesn't respect law & order, does not care what we ask him to do. He continues to misbehave with my sisters every alternate day. What can be done to stop him? What should we do to make sure he stays in his boundary and show some level of respect to his father & sisters.",

The important points to be noted are:- 1. Coal is delivered F.O.R/ F.O.B. colliery and no responsibility rest with the management once the trucks leave the colliery exit point with valid gate pass. 2. The trucks had crossed 4 Police Stations on their way and the informer, who wanted to implicate me in a false case, preferred a PS under his influence, 90 km away and 12 hours after the exit of trucks. 3. Police got samples of coal seized from the trucks analyzed in a state govt. laboratory. The results showed the coal to be of such higher quality that was not even available in that colliery! 4. A list of around 40 witnesses have been produced by the police, 33 of which are only such persons from whom seizure was made, e.g., Drivers, Helpers etc. 5. The case is transferred from one court to other of a Judicial Magistrate during the last 15 years. The charge sheet was filed only 5 years back u/s 420 & 120B. I have faced several transfers during these years. The State has been able to produce hardly 10 witnesses so far- all of whom have turned hostile. This, even after issuing summons through SP. 6. I am required to be present during every hearing fixed at 20 to 30 days'intervals. Even the Magistrates have agreed that it seems to be a false and fabricated case, but none of them have closed nor tried to see a logical end. Every Magistrate, over the years, nave promised that after 7 or 8 hearing, if no witness tuns up, he/ she would close the case. But by that time either he/ she gets transferred or the case is transferred to some other Magistrate. 7. My son is mentally retarded and is dependent upon me for his daily chores.Under the circumstances, I am finding it increasingly difficult, expensive and time consuming to attend court regularly, undertaking overnight train journeys. Even my applications for exemption from personal appearance have been turned down several no. of times. Kindly advice me some remedy to expedite the case!",

She was having an affair and was living with her BF after the marriage. In May 2015 she came to US and we filed for a no fault- mutual consent divorce. She was represented by a lawyer. She signed a settlement agreement submitting to the jurisdiction of US court and accepting that no DV or Dowry was ever put on her. She also waived any right to alimony or future money from any of the property and acknowledged that she can maintain her own lifestyle. This agreement was notarized by both of our lawyers and signed by me and her. This agreement was filed with the Divorce petition in the court and submitted. The court granted the divorce after 1 month on the date of hearing. Her lawyer and my lawyer attended the court hearing. I have copy of her agreement with her lawyer with me. The divorce was finalised on july 6. Now after all this time, she filed a complaint with CAW Cell in New Delhi alleging DV+Dowry. We are yet to go for first counselling. I want to know what should we do in CAW counselling? Should we bring out the fact that she has already filed for divorce and agreed to all the terms earlier? I am not sure if her lawyer gave her the divorce copy or not. Either ways, I have all paperwork in order. Any advice on future course of actions is appreciated. I believe if she does go ahead with filing 498A etc, the US court ruling in which she agreed to all terms would be useful?",

    "input": "I was arrested under section 143 of the Railways Act (https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706585/) by the Railway Protection Force (RPF). Basically, I am being framed for selling train tickets from a personal IRCTC ID, and not an agent ID. They confiscated a few tickets and got testimonies against me from a couple of customers stating how I charged them for procuring online train tickets. Generally, upon pleading guilty in such matters, the trial court of the Junior Railways Magistrate levies a nominal fine instead of sending the convict to jail. Yet, it likely constitutes a criminal conviction. My advocate has studied my case and concluded that this is a Warrant Trial in absence of a police report (FIR) based on a complaint made by RPF's Investigating Officer. So the charges will be framed by the Magistrate as the trial runs and the RPF has not filed a chargesheet and has made a complaint. For reference, RPF doesn't have the authority to file chargesheet under section 143 of the Railways Act as concluded by the Chattisgarh High Court in 2014. (https://highcourt.cg.gov.in/Afr/courtJudgementandAFR/2014/Sep/CRR37of4.pdf) Now the issue is that I want to avoid a criminal record as I am a young student. And my advocate is suggesting that since no FIR has been filed, pleading guilty and being fined won't really lead to a criminal background for me. So I am not sure whether I should contest the trial on the merits of the case or I should plead guilty and pay the fine. I seek your learned advice regarding the same. In case I plead guilty and pay the fine: 1) Will it lead to a criminal record and show up when a background check is conducted for me? (Say by an employer or by a landlord for renting purposes) 2) Will it debar me from getting a Visa? For example, Canada debars individuals with a criminal conviction for both minor and serious crimes for up to 10 years. (https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/overcome-criminal-convictions.html) Thanks for your answers.

After attending number of hearings and counselling, now they (both side lawyers also) and arrived a mutual agreement to settle issues like returning of jeweleries and alimony amount etc in the presence of the Judge. My question is should they again file a mutual divorce petition and wait for 6 months for getting the divorce or they can get the divorce order in the forthcoming hearing posted on 30.07.2014 itself. Kindly provide me your legal opinion on this which will be very helpful for my family to get rid of mental agony. with Best Regards, S.Ganapathi",

    "input": "Hi Lawyers, I had filed a case with the police in Chennai against a bride and their family for having cheated us money and breaching promise to marry because we did not agree to their breach of false promises based on which we agreed to conduct a formal engagement. Now the police had filed a FIR and filed charge sheet under section 417 and 420. The magistrate court has issued INDIVIDUAL \"Summons\" EACH OF THEM ADDRESSED TO EACH OF THE ACCUSED INDIVIDUALLY asking them to be present in person before the court for hearing on charges against them under section 417,420. My question is 1. What is this \"Summon\" as against a \"Warrant\"? 2. Is it mandatory for all 4 accused to be present or anyone of them can be present with their lawyer? 3. What is the implication if they are not present on the said date before the court and instead a lawyer makes a representation? 4. Is a Bail or Anticipatory Bail applicable to such a \"Summon\"?",

    "input": "Hello, I rented a shop in an almost closed down mall to make my office (Haryana). I did the contract with landlord for 3 years on a Rs.100 stamp paper. Its not registered. Now 4 months after I did all the work in the office like flooring, electricity, glass fittings, wood work etc. the landlord is demanding maintenance. The landlord is threatening to stop the electricity supply. I've not paid any maintenance till now. The contract clearly specifies that tenant is not under any obligation to pay any maintenance charges. 1. Is this UN-registered agreement VALID? 2. If I go to court will they ask me to pay the stamp duty? 3. The contract specifies that I can leave the property by giving 1 month notice. The contract does not however specify about the conditions to be followed by the landlord to remove/evict me from the property. Can they remove/evict me from the property if I go to court? I have invested a lot of money in the property (about 5 years of rent) 4. How to move forward? 5. The agreement is signed by the partner of the owner of the property. He gave me the signed paper (letterhead of the owner's company) on which the owner gave him permission to rent out the shops in the mall and the new construction of the mall will be done by both of them. 6. It is to be noted that the mall is undergoing construction. And it has not been maintained at all. Bathroom closed, stairs broken, etc.",
